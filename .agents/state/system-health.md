## Latest Validation Snapshot

| Check | Command or method | Result | Evidence | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lint | Not configured | NOT APPLICABLE | `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md` validation commands | Project has no lint script. |
| typecheck | `npm run build` | PASS (latest recorded) | `docs/operations/v1-operator-handoff.md`; recent V2WEB task evidence in `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md` | Build is the project typecheck gate. |
| tests | `docker compose exec -T backend sh -lc "npm run prisma:migrate:deploy && node --test 'dist/tests/**/*.test.js'"` | PASS | 2026-05-08 UXA-002 | Direct host `npm test` still requires a host-reachable `DATABASE_URL`; compose Postgres is internal only, so the integration test was run inside the backend container. |
| build | `npm run build` | PASS | 2026-05-08 UXA-003 | TypeScript build passed after dashboard markup, JS, and CSS changes. |
| smoke | Production public health smoke | PASS | 2026-05-08 AGRUN-009 public checks | `/health`, `/v1/health`, and web root returned `200`; `/health` reported build `71f3eb3b063ea68226a1736c727c52882b33f27a`. |
| ux/private smoke | `npm run owner-console:ux-smoke` against `http://localhost:3000` | PASS | `C:\Users\wrobl\AppData\Local\Temp\companycore-ux-smoke\2026-05-08T19-47-08-826Z` | Captured `/dashboard`, `/data`, `/data/tasks`, `/areas`, `/relationships`, `/settings/drive`, and `/settings/api` at desktop/tablet/mobile plus desktop interaction screenshots; report contained zero console issues. |
| ux/dashboard smoke | `npm run owner-console:ux-smoke` against isolated `http://localhost:3002` | PASS | `C:\Users\wrobl\AppData\Local\Temp\companycore-ux-smoke\2026-05-08T20-00-12-315Z` | UXA-003 dashboard screenshots show a dominant current-priority action, compact readiness evidence, top attention items, and secondary module exploration across desktop/tablet/mobile. |
| ux/auth smoke | Browser DOM check plus local Playwright viewport screenshots against `http://localhost:3003` | PASS | `C:\Users\wrobl\AppData\Local\Temp\companycore-auth-ux-smoke\2026-05-08T20-08-09-640Z` | UXA-004 verified mobile login/register form-first order, submit buttons inside the first viewport, preserved desktop two-column auth, and zero console issues. Browser screenshot capture timed out, so viewport screenshots used local Playwright fallback. |
| ux/workbench smoke | `npm run owner-console:ux-smoke` against isolated `http://localhost:3004` | PASS | `C:\Users\wrobl\AppData\Local\Temp\companycore-ux-smoke\2026-05-08T20-13-50-112Z` | UXA-005 verified private workbench routes after shared visual-role cleanup across desktop/tablet/mobile with zero console issues. |
| ux/local feedback smoke | Playwright fallback plus `npm run owner-console:ux-smoke` against isolated `http://localhost:3005` | PASS | `.tmp/uxa006-owner-console-rerun`; `.tmp/companycore-uxa006-login-local-status-rerun.png` | UXA-006 verified invalid login renders local error status, ClickUp/Drive empty status slots stay hidden, and private routes pass desktop/tablet/mobile smoke. Browser opened the route but interaction fallback was required because Browser failed on `locator.fill`. |
| ux/mobile header smoke | Targeted Playwright plus `npm run owner-console:ux-smoke` against isolated `http://localhost:3006` | PASS | `.tmp/uxa007-targeted`; `.tmp/uxa007-owner-console-rerun` | UXA-007 verified mobile topbar height `70px`, no horizontal overflow, drawer opens, Sign out remains visible, and desktop module search remains visible. |
| ux/dashboard iconography smoke | Browser login-page load plus targeted Playwright and `npm run owner-console:ux-smoke` against isolated `http://localhost:3000` | PASS | `.tmp/companycore-uxa008-targeted-final`; `.tmp/companycore-uxa008-owner-console-final` | UXA-008 verified local Phosphor font loading, 20 dashboard Phosphor icons on desktop, 18 visible in the first mobile viewport, no horizontal overflow, module icon color `rgb(35, 100, 210)`, and zero targeted console issues. |
| ux/react foundation smoke | Browser route load plus targeted Playwright and `npm run owner-console:ux-smoke` against isolated `http://localhost:3000` | PASS | `.tmp/companycore-uxa009-react-foundation`; `.tmp/companycore-uxa009-owner-console-final` | UXA-009 verified `/react-dashboard`, DaisyUI primary button and success alert, 3 table rows, owner-session detection on desktop/mobile, no horizontal overflow, and zero targeted console issues. |
| ux/react dashboard smoke | Targeted Playwright plus `npm run owner-console:ux-smoke` against isolated `http://localhost:3000` | PASS | `.tmp/companycore-uxa010-react-dashboard-final`; `.tmp/companycore-uxa010-owner-console-final` | UXA-010 verified `/react-dashboard` title, `companycore` DaisyUI theme, live `LuckySparrow` workspace data, 4 module links, 4 migration table rows, 13 Phosphor icons, desktop/mobile no horizontal overflow, and zero targeted console issues. |
| ux/react primitives smoke | Targeted Playwright plus `npm run owner-console:ux-smoke` against isolated `http://localhost:3000` | PASS | `.tmp/companycore-uxa011-react-primitives-final`; `.tmp/companycore-uxa011-owner-console-final` | UXA-011 verified `/react-dashboard` with 2 local notices, 1 reusable table primitive, 6 live table rows, internal table scroller, `companycore` theme, desktop/mobile no horizontal overflow, and zero targeted console issues. |
| ux/browser | Production public/auth Browser audit | PARTIAL PASS | 2026-05-08 UXA-001 | Public entry, login, register, and mobile auth rendered with no relevant console warnings/errors; authenticated Browser entry was blocked by an automation issue on `input[type=email]`. |
| local runtime | Docker local runtime for UX audit | PASS | 2026-05-08 UXA-001 | Local backend ran on `http://localhost:3001`; `/health` returned `ok`; migrations and seed completed. |
| web editor markers | Production `app.js` marker check | PASS | 2026-05-08 AGRUN-008 public `app.js` check | Typed editor markers for Notes, Projects, Clients, Task Lists, and Tasks are present. |
| operator handoff parity | Docs review | PASS | 2026-05-08 CCV1-062 | `v1-operator-handoff.md` and rollback docs now reference the current public health build and note the SSH inventory limitation. |

## Runtime Health

- Production CompanyCore, Jarvis, and Paperclip health were green in the latest
  v1 handoff evidence.
- CompanyCore public health currently reports image
  `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:71f3eb3b063ea68226a1736c727c52882b33f27a`.
- Known blockers are external: Google Drive owner consent/import,
  Paperclip/OpenJarvis upstream write access, and deploy-automation evidence
  reconciliation.
- Authenticated private-route UX screenshots now have an approved local
  Playwright path through `owner-console:ux-smoke`; UXA-003 used it to verify
  dashboard polish across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- UX smoke that depends on seeded owner state should use an isolated compose
  project when the default local volume has been touched by integration tests.
- UXA-006 confirmed integration tests and UX smoke must run sequentially when
  sharing one isolated compose database, because the integration test suite
  mutates seeded owner data.
- UXA-008 confirmed local Phosphor assets render from the backend-served static
  app without CDN dependency. Browser login-page load had no console issues;
  form filling used the approved Playwright fallback because the in-app browser
  hit the known form-fill limitation.
- UXA-009 confirmed React/Vite/Tailwind/DaisyUI assets can be generated into
  ignored `public/react/` output during build and copied from the Docker build
  stage into the runtime image.
- UXA-010 confirmed the React route can read the existing owner browser session
  boundary and `/v1/connection` without changing the vanilla dashboard route.
- UXA-011 confirmed generated React output should be cleaned before Vite builds
  and that table overflow must stay inside `.react-table-shell` on mobile.

## Quality Gate Notes

- Latest v1 handoff: `docs/operations/v1-operator-handoff.md`.
- Latest release readiness: `docs/operations/v1-release-readiness.md`.
- Required pre-commit contract remains the validation commands in
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`.
