# Delivery Map

Last updated: 2026-05-15

## Current Product Target

- Product: companycore
- Current release or milestone: application completion audit complete; pre-V2
  web/backend/MCP foundation in progress
- Primary user: owner/operator and policy-bound AI agents
- Primary outcome: CompanyCore becomes a production-quality human and agent
  Company OS control plane, with current audit findings driving the web,
  backend, and MCP foundation before V2 visuals are opened.
- Top blockers: remaining maintainability hotspots and broader route-frame
  convergence after the first dashboard frame.
- Next mission: start ACF-MAINT-002 Additional Hotspot Modularization unless
  the next UX checkpoint is explicitly prioritized.
- Closure handoff: `docs/operations/application-completion-audit-2026-05-14.md`.
