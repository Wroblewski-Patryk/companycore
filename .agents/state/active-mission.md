# Active Mission Packet

Last updated: 2026-05-25

## Current Mission

- Mission ID: ARCH-EVID-002-CONTINUATION
- Status: VERIFIED
- Selected objective: Complete the CSV-first architecture evidence nervous
  system with zero actionable gaps across evidence, chain coverage, and chain
  hardening outputs.
- Why this mission now: The owner requested uninterrupted continuation until
  the full architecture mapping and proof system is correctly implemented.
- Release objective or product milestone advanced: Architecture evidence
  runtime as canonical AI-operable project map.
- Stop conditions: no temporary bypasses; no unresolved evidence/chain queue
  rows in generated status artifacts; full integrity and coverage gates pass.
- Parent validation gate: `npm run architecture:refresh` and `npm run validate`.

## Source Rows

- Task contract:
  `docs/planning/architecture-evidence-system-foundation-task-contract.md`.
- Architecture source of truth:
  `docs/architecture/architecture-evidence-system.md`.
- Owner input: "digital nervous system" requirement with full chain/evidence
  graph mapping and AI-operable system behavior.

## Responsibility Lanes

| Lane | Owner | Source docs/state | Owned files/surfaces | Output | Validation/proof | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coordinator | Active chat | AGENTS, mission control, task contract | Mission integration, state updates, acceptance | Verified mission packet | Parent validation gate | VERIFIED |
| Architecture Runtime | Active chat | `docs/architecture/architecture-evidence-system.md` | `scripts/*architecture*`, `docs/status/*architecture*` | Deterministic refresh pipeline + gates | `npm run architecture:refresh` | VERIFIED |
| Data Integrity | Active chat | Node/chain/evidence CSV registries | `docs/architecture/nodes/*.csv`, `docs/architecture/chains/chains.csv` | Status/verification integrity convergence | integrity reports + zero actionable queues | VERIFIED |
| QA/Test | Active chat | DoD and integration checklist | Architecture pipeline + global validation | End-to-end proof | `npm run validate` | VERIFIED |
| Release/Handoff | Active chat | Project state and task board | State docs + architecture docs | Durable handoff and residual risk report | Validation summary | VERIFIED |

## Delegation Plan

- Lanes kept local: all lanes.
- Lanes delegated: none.
- Reason delegation was not used: this continuation checkpoint is a tightly
  coupled architecture-runtime hardening lane (`scripts/*architecture*` +
  source-of-truth/state sync), so serialization in one coordinator lane
  minimized cross-file drift.
- Known overlap risks: repository already contains unrelated in-progress
  architecture/deployment changes; this mission did not revert them.
