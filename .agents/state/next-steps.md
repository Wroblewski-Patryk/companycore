# Next Steps

Last updated: 2026-05-15

## NOW

1. Restore Google Drive OAuth usability for Jarvis.
   - Commit `fb6aca9` is deployed and lets `/settings/drive` repair OAuth even
     when old Google Drive ciphertext cannot be decrypted.
   - The current Jarvis container key is registered in CompanyCore and passes
     protected Google Drive smoke.
   - Complete owner Google Drive OAuth re-consent from `/settings/drive`, then
     rerun Jarvis Docs/Sheets creation/readback smoke.

## NEXT

1. AGRUN-010 Upstream Agent Source Merge Execution.
   - Blocked until upstream write access or an approved fork/PR route exists.
2. Production push-to-running-image smoke after the next deploy.
   - Build metadata restoration is implemented locally; after deploy, compare
     public `/health` `build.commit` with the pushed commit before claiming
     auto-deploy proof.
3. V1AREA follow-up verification and route convergence.
   - First unblock the host API gate by setting a valid local `DATABASE_URL`
     and running `npm run test:api` for the new `/dashboard` routing.
   - Then decide whether V1AREA-002 should converge `/areas` route body into
     the same area capability model or perform a tighter pixel-parity pass
     against the current desktop/mobile canonical images.

## LATER

1. ACF-UX-002 Company City Dashboard / Gamified Strategic Map.
   - Deferred to V2 readiness gate.
2. ACF-OPS-001 Auto-Deploy Proof Or Manual Path Acceptance.
3. ACF-QA-001 Lint And Split Test Gates.
4. AGRUN-010 Upstream Agent Source Merge Execution, blocked until upstream
   write access or an approved fork/PR route exists.

## Selection Rules

- Pick one bounded mission objective for each autonomous iteration; use small
  checkpoint tasks inside that mission when useful.
- Prefer tasks that reduce blocker risk, regression risk, or unclear source of
  truth.
- Do not start new feature work when a P0/P1 regression or release blocker is
  unresolved.
- Keep this file synchronized with `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md` and
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`.
