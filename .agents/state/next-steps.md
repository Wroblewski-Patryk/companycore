# Next Steps

Last updated: 2026-05-15

## NOW

1. V2VIS-004 Next Route Body UX Polish Cycle.
   - Repeat the 100-findings-plus-implementation UX cycle on the next dense
     private route, likely `/settings/api` safety workflow or `/settings/drive`
     import/scoping.

## NEXT

1. ACF-MAINT-002 Additional Hotspot Modularization.
   - Continue reducing delivery risk in the remaining large web/API/test
     hotspots after V2VIS-002 closed the first route-frame convergence slice.

## LATER

1. ACF-UX-002 Company City Dashboard / Gamified Strategic Map.
   - Deferred to V2 readiness gate.
2. ACF-OPS-001 Auto-Deploy Proof Or Manual Path Acceptance.
3. ACF-QA-001 Lint And Split Test Gates.
4. AGRUN-010 Upstream Agent Source Merge Execution, blocked until upstream
   write access or an approved fork/PR route exists.

## Selection Rules

- Pick one bounded mission objective for each autonomous iteration; use small
  checkpoint tasks inside that mission when useful.
- Prefer tasks that reduce blocker risk, regression risk, or unclear source of
  truth.
- Do not start new feature work when a P0/P1 regression or release blocker is
  unresolved.
- Keep this file synchronized with `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md` and
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`.
