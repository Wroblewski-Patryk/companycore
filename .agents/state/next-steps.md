# Next Steps

Last updated: 2026-05-15

## NOW

No active ready UX100 implementation wave remains after UX100-W05.

## NEXT

1. AGRUN-010 Upstream Agent Source Merge Execution.
   - Blocked until upstream write access or an approved fork/PR route exists.
2. Restore build commit/image metadata in production health.
   - Future deployability improvement so push-to-running-image proof can be
     captured without privileged Coolify inspection.

## LATER

1. ACF-UX-002 Company City Dashboard / Gamified Strategic Map.
   - Deferred to V2 readiness gate.
2. ACF-OPS-001 Auto-Deploy Proof Or Manual Path Acceptance.
3. ACF-QA-001 Lint And Split Test Gates.
4. AGRUN-010 Upstream Agent Source Merge Execution, blocked until upstream
   write access or an approved fork/PR route exists.

## Selection Rules

- Pick one bounded mission objective for each autonomous iteration; use small
  checkpoint tasks inside that mission when useful.
- Prefer tasks that reduce blocker risk, regression risk, or unclear source of
  truth.
- Do not start new feature work when a P0/P1 regression or release blocker is
  unresolved.
- Keep this file synchronized with `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md` and
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`.
