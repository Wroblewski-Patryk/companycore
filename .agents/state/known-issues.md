## Open Issues

| ID | Severity | Area | Summary | Owner | Status | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KI-001 | P1 | Google Drive | Production Drive folder discovery can still return zero folders until the local OAuth callback/folder discovery/content-indexing patch is deployed and smoked. | Ops/Release | IMPLEMENTED_NOT_VERIFIED | Deploy AGRUN-007 patch, then rerun production `/settings/drive` folder discovery and first selected-folder import with the connected owner account. |
| KI-002 | P2 | Release automation | GitHub-to-Coolify auto-deploy is not proven as reliable; manual VPS backend rollover remains the approved path. | Ops/Release | MONITORING | Record a push-to-running-image smoke before claiming auto-deploy is reliable. |
| KI-003 | P2 | Source handoff | Paperclip and OpenJarvis validated source changes could not be pushed upstream because GitHub returned `403`. | Ops/Release | BLOCKED | Resume AGRUN-010 after write access or an approved fork/PR route exists. |

## Accepted Residual Risks

- 2026-05-06: Manual VPS/Coolify rollover remains an accepted v1 release path
  while GitHub-to-Coolify webhook/auto-deploy administration is unresolved.
