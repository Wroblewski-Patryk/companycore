## Open Issues

| ID | Severity | Area | Summary | Owner | Status | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KI-001 | P1 | Google Drive | First real Drive owner consent and selected-folder import cannot be proven until OAuth credentials and owner action are available. | Ops/Release | BLOCKED | Resume AGRUN-007 when credentials and consent are available. |
| KI-002 | P2 | Release automation | GitHub-to-Coolify auto-deploy is not proven as reliable; manual VPS backend rollover remains the approved path. | Ops/Release | MONITORING | Record a push-to-running-image smoke before claiming auto-deploy is reliable. |
| KI-003 | P2 | Source handoff | Paperclip and OpenJarvis validated source changes could not be pushed upstream because GitHub returned `403`. | Ops/Release | BLOCKED | Resume AGRUN-010 after write access or an approved fork/PR route exists. |
