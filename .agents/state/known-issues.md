## Open Issues

| ID | Severity | Area | Summary | Owner | Status | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KI-014 | P1 | API/service-key security | New owner-created API keys can default to broad access because empty scopes are treated as broad compatibility and the API-key create route uses `[]` when no profile/scopes are supplied. | Security + Backend Builder | OPEN | Implement `FOUNDATION-003`: require a profile or explicit scopes for new keys, preserving broad handling only for legacy compatibility or explicit full-access confirmation. |
| KI-013 | P1 | API contract consistency | Backend routes commonly return `{ error: "code" }` while the documented API error contract expects a stable `error.code` and safe message envelope. | Backend Builder + Frontend Builder | OPEN | Implement `FOUNDATION-002`: add a shared API error helper and migrate high-traffic routes first while preserving frontend compatibility. |
| KI-012 | P1 | Local validation environment | Full API integration validation is not one-command reliable: `DATABASE_URL` is not set by default in the shell, and Docker daemon commands timed out during the 2026-05-18 foundation audit. | QA/Test + Ops/Release | OPEN | Implement `FOUNDATION-001`: add a repeatable local API test database runner with disposable PostgreSQL setup, migration/test execution, and cleanup. |
| KI-011 | P2 | Local validation environment | During OPS-MGMT-002, Docker CLI/daemon commands timed out while trying to start or inspect a disposable PostgreSQL container, blocking `npm run test:api` proof for the new Operations task-list endpoint. | QA/Test + Ops/Release | OPEN | Rerun `npm run test:api` on a healthy PostgreSQL validation environment before upgrading OPS-MGMT-002 confidence to High. |
| KI-008 | P2 | Google Drive production OAuth write/read samples | Historical production OAuth decrypt/write-read evidence was stale after a prior secret incident. The 2026-05-16 production audit proves the stored Google Drive OAuth path can list/import selected folders and refresh content snapshots, but Docs/Sheets write samples and `changes/reconcile` still need targeted proof. | Ops/Release + Owner | MITIGATED | Run a target-safe Docs/Sheets write/read smoke and the KI-009 changes-reconcile diagnostic before closing the historical OAuth concern completely. |
| KI-007 | P1 | Product data completeness | Production `/v1/operating-model` has 13 areas and 26 external mappings but `0` storage locations, `0` knowledge roots, `0` automation definitions, and `/v1/projects` returns `0` while tasks exist. | Product + Backend | OPEN | Execute ACF-PROD-001 to decide, seed, import, or explicitly defer these owner-facing operating model records. |
| KI-002 | P2 | Release automation | GitHub-to-Coolify auto-deploy is not proven as reliable; manual VPS/Coolify backend rollover remains the accepted and approved path. | Ops/Release | ACCEPTED | After the next deploy, compare public `/health` `build.commit` with the pushed commit before claiming push-to-running-image proof. |
| KI-003 | P2 | Source handoff | Paperclip and OpenJarvis validated source changes could not be pushed upstream because GitHub returned `403`. | Ops/Release | BLOCKED | Resume AGRUN-010 after write access or an approved fork/PR route exists. |

## Accepted Residual Risks

- 2026-05-06: Manual VPS/Coolify rollover remains an accepted v1 release path
  while GitHub-to-Coolify webhook/auto-deploy administration is unresolved.
- 2026-05-15: ACF-OPS-001 refreshed public web/API health evidence. Both
  domains are healthy, but `/health` reports `commit: unknown` and
  `image: unknown`, so automatic deployment cannot be proven from public
  metadata. Manual VPS/Coolify rollover remains the accepted path.
- 2026-05-15: ACF-OPS-002 restored source-level build metadata wiring and
  regression coverage. The release-automation proof gap remains accepted until
  the next deployed runtime is checked through public `/health`.
- 2026-05-15: Post-push public smoke after `ec82a1a` returned `200` for
  `https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/health`,
  `https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/health`, and
  `https://companycore.luckysparrow.ch/`, but both API health endpoints still
  reported `build.commit="unknown"` and `build.image="unknown"`. Treat this as
  uptime evidence only, not push-to-running-image proof.

## Recently Closed Issues

- KI-010 Paperclip runtime key selection: closed on 2026-05-16 after production
  Paperclip DB/runtime proof showed `company_core_settings` is configured with
  CompanyCore base URL, a knowledge key, and a tools key. Knowledge calls to
  `/v1/connection`, `/v1/mcp/manifest`, and `/v1/google-drive/files` returned
  `200`; tools calls to `/v1/connection` and `/v1/google-drive/files` returned
  `200`; and Paperclip had 1282 CompanyCore tool assignments across 36 agents,
  including 12 distinct Google Drive tools. If a specific agent still misses
  files, treat it as an agent assignment/filter UX issue, not a missing global
  bridge key.
- KI-009 Google Drive changes reconciliation: closed by PROD-GDRIVE-002 on
  2026-05-16. Production was manually rolled over to commit
  `d2c9b9460a5db63703ca28f98988a2fa35d3a651`; first protected production
  reconcile initialized `newStartPageToken=25137` with
  `baselineInitialized=true`, and second reconcile returned `200` through the
  stored-token path.
- V1 runtime readiness: closed by `docs/operations/v1-operator-handoff.md` and
  `docs/operations/v1-release-readiness.md`.
- KI-004 authenticated private-route screenshot gap: closed by UXA-002 on
  2026-05-08 with `owner-console:ux-smoke`, covering seven private routes at
  desktop/tablet/mobile and reporting zero console issues.
- Deploy automation evidence drift: closed by AGRUN-009 on 2026-05-08; the
  historical `63348d6` note is not accepted as superseding operations evidence.
- KI-004 Company OS cockpit generic collection 404s: closed by
  V2WEB-AGENT-022 on 2026-05-14. Shared table-record path resolution now sends
  Company OS collection slugs to `/v1/company-os/:collection`; mock render
  proof reported `badGeneric=[]`, `notFound=[]`, and `consoleErrors=[]`.
- KI-005 mobile overflow and focus accessibility: closed by ACF-UX-001 on
  2026-05-14. Desktop/mobile Playwright fallback checks for `/settings/api` and
  `/react-company-os` reported `horizontalOverflow=false`,
  `unnamedFocusableCount=0`, no console warnings/errors, and no relevant failed
  requests.
- KI-006 production secret and CORS hardening: closed by ACF-SEC-001 on
  2026-05-14. `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55452`
  verified missing-secret failure, development-placeholder rejection,
  production CORS allow/deny behavior, and the existing protected API flow.
