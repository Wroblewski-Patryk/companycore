# Project Memory Index

Last updated: 2026-05-15

## Purpose

This file is the mandatory full-picture protocol for agents. It prevents the
project from drifting into repeated small fixes with no clear release progress.
Every non-trivial task must connect local code changes to the current product
state, architecture intent, module confidence, and the next release objective.

## Required Indexes

Agents must keep these indexes current enough that another Codex session can
continue from repository files alone:

- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`: where the project is now, current phase,
  validation commands, deployment shape, and known runtime reality.
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`: canonical task queue with `NOW`, `NEXT`,
  blockers, and done evidence.
- `.agents/core/mission-control.md`: mission block rules for multi-hour
  autonomous work.
- `.agents/state/module-confidence-ledger.md`: module-by-module confidence,
  working state, evidence, and next proof or fix.
- `.agents/state/system-health.md`: latest validation, broken journeys, stale
  checks, and environment state.
- `.agents/state/known-issues.md`: real unresolved defects, not vague concerns.
- `.agents/state/next-steps.md`: next executable tasks in priority order.
- `docs/architecture/`: current architecture truth.
- `docs/modules/` or module maps when present: implementation ownership and
  surface maps.
- `docs/planning/`: release plan and task sequencing.
- `docs/operations/`: release, deploy, smoke, rollback, and target-environment
  evidence.
- `docs/ux/`: approved visual direction, design-system rules, reusable UX
  memory, and pattern guidance. As of 2026-05-14, high-level dashboard and map
  work must preserve the accepted Company City strategic-map direction unless a
  new decision supersedes it.
- `docs/planning/human-agent-web-architecture-map.md`: current V2
  human-agent web direction. As of 2026-05-14, `/react-agent-tools` exposes
  the owner-visible MCP tool surface, and `/react-company-os` includes the
  correlation timeline, operating graph detail, and workflow-grade command
  panel slices.
- `docs/architecture/company-os-definition-editing-contract.md`: Company OS
  definition editing safety contract. It classifies which definitions may use
  scoped CRUD, command routes, versioning, approval, or no raw editing. As of
  2026-05-14, `standards` has the first Class A backend write contract through
  `company-os:definition:write`; the narrow web editor is implemented and
  verified.
- `docs/architecture/company-os-workflow-definition-command-contract.md`:
  workflow definition command/version contract. It blocks raw CRUD over active
  processes, pipelines, stages, procedures, and steps, and defines draft,
  impact preview, approval, activation, archive, rollback, evidence, and MCP
  exposure requirements. As of 2026-05-14, V2WEB-AGENT-009 implemented
  draft/update/impact-preview backend commands, V2WEB-AGENT-010 implemented
  approval-aware procedure activation, V2WEB-AGENT-011 added process and
  pipeline versioning plus activation, V2WEB-AGENT-012 added the guarded web
  surface for workflow draft create, impact preview, approval request, and
  activation gating, V2WEB-AGENT-013 selected draft history/readback before
  archive/rollback, V2WEB-AGENT-014 added guarded draft list/detail readback
  plus draft-only resume in `/react-company-os`, and V2WEB-AGENT-015 selected
  phased recovery commands: inactive historical-version archive first, then
  rollback-draft creation through existing preview and activation.
  V2WEB-AGENT-016 implemented the inactive historical-version archive backend
  command, and V2WEB-AGENT-017 implemented rollback-draft creation without
  direct rollback execution. V2WEB-AGENT-018 selected a dedicated web recovery
  panel, and V2WEB-AGENT-019 implemented `/react-company-os` recovery controls.
  V2WEB-AGENT-020/021 selected and implemented explicit `family_id` lineage on
  process, pipeline, and procedure roots so rollback-draft creation works
  across renamed historical versions. V2WEB-AGENT-022 fixed Company OS
  collection fetch paths, V2WEB-AGENT-023 proved the full UI recovery flow
  through inline approval decision and activation, and V2WEB-AGENT-024 repeated
  that flow against a migrated Docker Compose backend.
- `docs/architecture/organizational-architecture-bridge.md`: accepted
  long-term AI-first CompanyCore direction. As of 2026-05-15, CompanyCore is
  intended to become an organizational operating system and graph that connects
  humans, AI agents, vertical hierarchy, horizontal APQC-style process flow,
  MECE responsibility ownership, PAEI behavior profiles, governance, workflows,
  knowledge, resources, KPIs, audit, decisions, web/mobile clients, MCP, and
  Paperclip. Future work must reuse existing Company OS and operating-model
  tables before adding duplicate target-named tables. As of 2026-05-15,
  Paperclip's minimum company-building direction is also recorded there:
  CompanyCore remains a non-embedded-AI operating app, while external agents use
  API/MCP layers for Intent, Knowledge, Planning and orchestration, Tools,
  Access and autonomy, and Audit and feedback. Future Paperclip work should
  first close the business-plan/context-to-task loop through existing
  knowledge, task, ClickUp, MCP, event, approval, and audit foundations.
- `docs/architecture/web-layer-react-ownership.md`: current web route
  ownership contract. As of 2026-05-15, user-facing web routes are React-owned
  and served from the Vite bundle in `public/react/index.html`. The legacy
  vanilla owner console files under `public/` are removed from active runtime
  ownership. `/dashboard` is the canonical authenticated post-login route, and
  `web/src/app-route-registry.ts` is the React route metadata source for
  groups, aliases, shell navigation, and post-auth redirect normalization.
  `/areas` remains the all-areas workbench, while
  `/areas?area=:areaKey&view=:viewId` is the canonical selected-department
  drill-down. As of V1AREA-003, selected-department capability tabs render
  area-scoped boards for goals, workflows, tasks, knowledge, resources,
  decisions, AI, and add-view planning from existing backend data. Future web
  slices must extend `web/src/` and the route registry instead of
  reintroducing page-local vanilla scripts or duplicated sidebar route maps.
- `docs/ux/v1-web-view-index-2026-05-15.md`: current V1 web UX maturity
  index. It marks `/dashboard` and `/areas?area=:areaKey&view=:viewId` as V1
  canonical, foundation routes as usable but not canonical yet, and remaining
  module/workbench/admin routes as V0 rebuild or compatibility surfaces.
  V1PROD-001 adds production parity status: production health currently reports
  `b716f02`, while the V1 canonical web layer exists in the local working tree,
  so production parity is blocked by deploy drift. Future web UX tasks should
  update this index when route maturity or production parity changes.
- `docs/ux/v1-production-canonical-discrepancy-audit-2026-05-15.md`: current
  production-to-canonical discrepancy register for the five V1 web surfaces.
  It records the original deployed screenshots, root/auth mismatches,
  signed-out private redirect evidence, and the V1PROD-002 post-deploy update.
  Production now runs `ff5e041`; public/signed-out skeleton parity is proven,
  while authenticated dashboard and selected-area screenshot parity remains
  the open private-route proof.
- `docs/ux/v1-settings-canonical-spec-2026-05-15.md`: current canonical
  planning target for the unified V1 settings module. It defines `/settings`
  as a minimal credential surface with sections for Integrations, Agent keys,
  and MCP. Settings must not contain badges, counters, sync/import queues,
  folder mapping, relationship review, large MCP catalogs, or dashboard-style
  metrics; those belong in dedicated work views. The
  desktop/mobile target images are
  `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-settings-desktop-canonical.png` and
  `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-settings-mobile-canonical.png`.
- `docs/architecture/relationship-graph-audit-2026-05-14.md`: current
  relationship graph source audit for the pre-V2 web/backend/MCP foundation.
  Relationship APIs and UI must distinguish direct database edges,
  provider-derived hierarchy, route-inferred table-to-record links,
  needs-review items, and unsupported relation families. WEBFOUND-008A added
  read-only `GET /v1/relationships/graph` plus `relationships:read` MCP
  exposure. WEBFOUND-008B made `/relationships` consume that API, and
  WEBFOUND-009 added `/settings/integrations` readiness cards for ClickUp,
  Google Drive, relationship graph, and MCP agent access. WEBFOUND-010 added
  `/settings/api` workspace/risk/MCP tool preview before service key creation.
  WEBFOUND-011 connected `/react-agent-tools` to the canonical shell and
  removed the separate React preview navigation taxonomy from the shared React
  shell. WEBFOUND-012 added a repeatable AI-ready smoke for disposable owner
  bootstrap, MCP reader/operator profile keys, manifest visibility, HTTP/MCP
  relationship graph reads, and default guarded-command blocking. WEBFOUND-013
  approved WEBFOUND-014 visual planning while keeping direct Company City and
  gamification implementation gated on a canonical shell/map/brief/status
  plan. WEBFOUND-014 added that canonical visual implementation plan and the
  first future candidate `V2VIS-001 Shared CompanyShell And Dashboard Frame`.
  The WEBFOUND queue is complete. Do not add a
  generic edge table or fake relationship data before a concrete editable
  workflow proves the need.
- Google Drive integration memory: as of 2026-05-14, Google Drive uses one
  workspace OAuth connection for Drive, Docs, and Sheets. The callback route is
  `/settings/drive`; private-route login redirects must preserve callback query
  parameters until the backend token exchange completes. Folder discovery must
  request `mimeType`, and imports refresh searchable content snapshots for
  Google Docs and Sheets. Production now runs commit
  `c5878d95a47f17745f65689c08e9e317a6465777`; OAuth is active, protected smoke
  passes, and owner discovery returns 172 folders. The numbered department
  roots `00`-`12` have been selected, imported, and mapped; first import is no
  longer a blocker. Future Drive work should focus on freshness,
  content-quality, Docs/Sheets write, or changes reconciliation only when those
  become active scope.

If one of these files is missing, empty, stale, or still template-like, rebuild
the minimum useful version from architecture docs, context files, accepted
feedback, code, tests, and planning notes before choosing implementation work.
Every inferred row must name its source and use a cautious status.

## Architecture Refresh Protocol

When architecture, module boundaries, app flow, route ownership, data model,
runtime behavior, UX system, or deployment shape changes, the same task must
refresh the relevant indexes before it can be called done.

Minimum refresh checklist:

1. Update the canonical architecture or ADR file that owns the decision.
2. Update module maps or route/component/API ownership docs when affected.
3. Update `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md` if phase, stack, deploy shape,
   validation commands, or runtime reality changed.
4. Update `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md` and `docs/planning/*` so the next
   task queue reflects the new architecture.
5. Update `.agents/state/module-confidence-ledger.md` for every affected
   module.
6. Update `.agents/state/system-health.md` when validation, smoke, deploy, or
   runtime status changed.
7. Record unresolved mismatches in `.agents/state/known-issues.md`.

Architecture changes left only in chat, commit messages, or scattered planning
notes are not accepted as source of truth.

## Module Confidence Ledger Protocol

Use `.agents/state/module-confidence-ledger.md` as the fast answer to:

- Which modules exist?
- Which user journeys does each module own?
- Does it work in the real app?
- What evidence proves that?
- What is blocked, broken, stale, or unverified?
- What is the next smallest proof or fix?

Before selecting a new implementation task, read the ledger and prefer work in
this order:

1. `BROKEN` or `FAIL` release-critical journeys.
2. `BLOCKED` release-critical journeys.
3. `IMPLEMENTED_NOT_VERIFIED` P0/P1 journeys.
4. `PARTIAL` journeys where evidence points to a real defect.
5. New features only after release-critical existing flows are stable or
   explicitly deferred.

Do not convert unknowns into features. First create a verification task. Create
a fix only when proof, code inspection, or a reproducible user journey shows a
real defect.

## Reality Language Rule

Agents must not report vague completion states such as "almost done", "close",
"should work", "looks good", or "probably fixed" without evidence.

Allowed completion language:

- `verified`: evidence exists and is recorded.
- `implemented, not verified`: code exists but proof is missing.
- `partially verified`: exact passing and missing scenarios are listed.
- `blocked`: exact blocker and next unblock action are listed.
- `failed`: fresh verification failed and the failure is recorded.

The user should not be the first tester of a core journey. If a task affects a
browser, mobile, API, auth, data, money, AI, or deployment flow, the agent must
run the relevant automated or manual journey proof where local access allows it.

## Real Journey Proof

For user-facing work, validation must prove the real journey, not just that code
compiled. Examples:

- create, edit, delete, and refresh the target entity when CRUD changed;
- navigate from the real entry point, not only direct route access;
- verify loading, empty, error, success, and blocked states when the action has
  those states;
- verify persistence after reload or service restart when data changes;
- verify mobile or responsive behavior when the surface is browser-facing;
- verify auth, ownership, and fail-closed behavior when data access matters.

If a journey cannot be exercised locally, record why, the residual risk, and the
next best proof. Do not mark the module as working.

## Full-Picture Mission Selection

Every autonomous run must start by answering:

- Where are we now?
- What is the final or current release objective?
- Which module or journey is the biggest blocker to that objective?
- What evidence do we already have?
- What mission or checkpoint would most increase release confidence?

Only then select one scoped mission or checkpoint. Small tasks are useful as
mission slices only when they are anchored to the release picture.

## Handoff Requirement

After substantial work, update the indexes and leave the next agent a clear
handoff:

- current objective;
- files and modules changed;
- evidence collected;
- module confidence changes;
- known broken or unverified journeys;
- next tiny task.
