# Requirements Verification System

Use this system to turn product intent into verifiable requirements. Significant
feature, journey, integration, architecture, UX, security, AI, mobile, ops, and
release work must be traceable from source to proof.

Core chain:

`source -> decision -> requirement -> delivery map -> mission -> code -> verification -> evidence -> confidence`

## Required State Files

- `.agents/state/requirements-verification-matrix.md`
- `.agents/state/quality-attribute-scenarios.md`
- `.agents/state/risk-register.md`

## Requirement Rules

- Use stable IDs such as `REQ-FUNC-###`, `REQ-UX-###`, `REQ-DATA-###`,
  `REQ-API-###`, `REQ-AI-###`, `REQ-SEC-###`, `REQ-OPS-###`, and
  `REQ-MOB-###`.
- Every meaningful requirement needs a verification method: `test`,
  `inspection`, `demonstration`, or `analysis`.
- Use only evidence-backed statuses: `proposed`, `accepted`, `in_progress`,
  `implemented_not_verified`, `partially_verified`, `verified`, `failed`,
  `blocked`, `superseded`.
- Do not report work as done without updating the requirement matrix and module
  confidence ledger.

## Quality And Risk Rules

Capture quality scenarios when a change affects usability, accessibility,
performance, reliability, security, maintainability, observability,
deployment, AI behavior, or mobile readiness.

Track risks when they can affect user trust, architecture, delivery, data,
security, money, AI actions, deployment, or maintainability.

## Tables, Analyses, And Reports

Durable tables should include stable ID, source, affected module, status,
evidence, next action, and last updated date. Free-form notes may explain
context, but actionable state belongs in a table, ledger, queue, checklist, or
register.

## Autonomous Continuation Rule

When the user says "continue", "next", "rob dalej", "jedziemy dalej", or
similar, choose the highest-value requirement that is `failed`, `blocked`,
`implemented_not_verified`, or release-critical `accepted`; then run one
mission tied to requirement IDs, verify it, and update all affected state files.
