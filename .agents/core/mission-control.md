# Mission Control

Last updated: 2026-05-11

## Purpose

This file supersedes any older wording that says an agent must always finish
after exactly one tiny task. Agents may work for several hours inside one
bounded mission, as long as progress remains visible, recoverable, and proven.

The goal is not smallness for its own sake. The goal is controlled forward
motion from current reality toward the release objective.

## Mission Block

A mission block is a bounded work session that may contain multiple small tasks
when they belong to one coherent objective.

The default execution shape is coordinator-first. The active chat is the
mission coordinator. For broad or multi-layer work, it should hire bounded
subagents for the responsibilities needed by the mission, integrate their
results, and close the mission only after parent-level validation.

Every mission must define current project state, target outcome, release
objective, owned modules/files, included and excluded tasks, validation gates,
checkpoint cadence, stop conditions, expected handoff artifact, and
responsibility lanes with assigned agents when subagents are useful.

## Coordinator-First Default

When the user asks to `pracuj dalej`, `rob dalej`, `kontynuuj`, `next`, `go`, or
otherwise continue a documented objective, the agent should assume the
coordinator role by default.

The coordinator must translate architecture docs, planning docs, state files,
ledgers, and prior evidence into active responsibility lanes; create or refresh
`.agents/state/active-mission.md` before broad implementation starts; decide
which lanes stay local and which can be delegated; brief each subagent with
objective, ownership, non-goals, validation, and expected report; keep critical
path, integration, acceptance, and final done-state local; treat subagent
reports as evidence, not approval; and capture missing ownership, failed
handoffs, repeated mistakes, or unclear responsibility as process learning.

Typical lanes include product/requirements, architecture, backend, frontend,
data/migrations, QA/test, security, UX, documentation, and ops/release.

Do not spawn subagents just to look busy. Use them when the lanes are separable
and when a coordinator can verify the integrated result.

## Work Unit Rules

- Use one mission objective, not one random tiny task.
- Split the mission into small checkpoints, not isolated chat-sized fixes.
- Keep file ownership explicit when subagents or parallel work are used.
- Do not mix unrelated modules just because the agent has time.
- Do not start a second mission until the current mission has a status update,
  evidence, or a clear blocked handoff.
- If the mission uncovers a higher-priority P0 defect, record it in the module
  confidence ledger and either switch with explanation or stop for a decision.
- If subagents report that work was blocked because no lane owned a necessary
  responsibility, update the mission plan and record the missing responsibility
  in `.codex/context/LEARNING_JOURNAL.md`, `.agents/state/known-issues.md`,
  or the relevant planning/state file.
- On the next similar mission, include that responsibility as an explicit lane
  before implementation begins.

## Checkpoint Cadence

For long-running work, update repository state after initial analysis, each
meaningful implementation slice, each validation pass or failure, before
changing direction, and before ending the session.

Checkpoint notes must answer what changed, what was proven, what failed or
stayed unknown, which module confidence rows changed, what remains in this
mission, and whether the release objective moved forward.

## Mission Status Vocabulary

- `PLANNED`
- `IN_PROGRESS`
- `CHECKPOINTED`
- `VERIFIED`
- `PARTIALLY_VERIFIED`
- `BLOCKED`
- `FAILED`
- `SUPERSEDED`

Never use "almost done", "close", or "should work" as a status.

## Evidence Requirements

Each mission must produce durable task board, project state, module confidence,
validation, real journey, residual-risk, and next-action evidence when those
surfaces are affected.

## Relationship To Tiny Tasks

Tiny tasks are mission slices, not the operating goal. Use a mission block when
a module needs end-to-end closure, a UI flow needs implementation plus proof, or
a release confidence gap spans code, docs, and tests.

## Handoff

Record mission status, completed slices, changed files/modules, evidence links,
module confidence changes, blockers, decisions needed, and the next recommended
mission or checkpoint.
