# LEARNING_JOURNAL

Purpose: keep a compact memory of recurring execution pitfalls and verified
fixes for this repository.

## Update Rules

- Add or update an entry when a failure pattern is reproducible or documented.
- Prefer updating an existing entry over creating duplicates.
- Keep entries in English and free of secrets.
- Apply the new guardrail in the same task where the learning is captured.
- For approved reusable UX or visual patterns, also update
  `docs/ux/design-memory.md`.

## Entries

### 2026-04-30 - Canonical visuals require surface-by-surface closure

- Context: Screenshot-driven UI work can drift when agents treat approved
  images as inspiration, spread polish across multiple surfaces, or replace
  required assets with generic CSS approximations.
- Learning: A canonical screenshot, mockup, or approved frame must be treated
  as the active spec. Explicit user notes become part of that spec.
- Guardrail: For pixel-close UI tasks, use
  `docs/ux/canonical-visual-implementation-workflow.md`, close one surface at a
  time, capture comparison screenshots, list visible mismatches, and require an
  explicit `95%` parity judgment before moving to dependent surfaces.

### 2026-04-30 - UX audits should become action-first evidence

- Context: Broad UI passes can produce screenshots without changing the
  product's day-to-day usefulness.
- Learning: Full-route clickthroughs are most useful when they answer whether
  each screen makes the next action, blocked state, and recovery path obvious.
- Guardrail: Use `docs/ux/evidence-driven-ux-review.md` for broad UX work,
  keep feedback local to user actions, hide raw technical errors from end
  users, and convert findings into the next one or two implementation slices.

### 2026-05-02 - Prisma SQL migrations must not contain BOM
- Context: CCV1-006 integration tests applied Prisma migrations to a fresh
  PostgreSQL database through `prisma migrate deploy`.
- Symptom: The first migration failed with PostgreSQL syntax error at the first
  character before `-- CreateEnum`.
- Root cause: `prisma/migrations/202605021_v1_foundation/migration.sql`
  started with a UTF-8 BOM.
- Guardrail: SQL migration files must be UTF-8 without BOM before commit and
  `prisma migrate deploy` must be exercised against a fresh database.
- Preferred pattern: Run the endpoint test command against a disposable fresh
  PostgreSQL database so migration encoding and ordering issues surface early.
- Avoid: Trusting `npm run build` or Prisma Client generation as proof that
  migrations apply cleanly.
- Evidence: `npm test` initially failed with PostgreSQL error code `42601` at
  the BOM character, then passed after rewriting the migration without BOM.

### 2026-05-02 - Existing production schemas need Prisma baseline before migrate deploy

- Context: CompanyCore production on Coolify already contained the foundation
  schema before the runtime switched to `prisma migrate deploy`.
- Symptom: Backend restarted continuously and logs showed Prisma `P3005`
  because the database schema was not empty.
- Root cause: The production database had application tables but no
  `_prisma_migrations` metadata row for the already-applied foundation schema.
- Guardrail: Before enabling `prisma migrate deploy` against an existing
  production database, compare current tables to the intended baseline and add
  only the matching baseline migration metadata; never delete the Postgres
  volume to clear `P3005`.
- Preferred pattern: Baseline the exact already-applied migration, redeploy the
  latest commit, then verify backend logs and public health endpoints.
- Avoid: Treating `P3005` as a reason to reset production data or blindly mark
  later migrations as applied.
- Evidence: Coolify backend logs showed `P3005`; after a one-time baseline for
  `202605021_v1_foundation`, redeploying commit `3f64a72` finished, logs showed
  `No pending migrations to apply`, seed success, and `/health` plus
  `/v1/health` returned `200`.
