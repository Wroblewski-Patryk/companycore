## Blocked

- AGRUN-007 Google Drive Owner Consent And First Import
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P1
  - Blocked by: real Google OAuth credentials and owner consent/import action
    are required before target-environment evidence can be produced.
- AGRUN-010 Upstream Agent Source Merge Execution
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P2
  - Blocked by: external GitHub write access or an approved fork/PR route for
    Paperclip and OpenJarvis source handoff.
- CCV1-057B Paperclip upstream branch push
  - Stage: release
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P2
  - Blocked by: GitHub returned `403` for pushing
    `codex/companycore-adapter-v1` to `paperclipai/paperclip` as
    `Wroblewski-Patryk`. The adapter commit is validated locally and remains
    available as `4cfa476f` plus the managed CompanyCore patch.
- CCV1-058B OpenJarvis upstream branch push
  - Stage: release
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P2
  - Blocked by: GitHub returned `403` for pushing
    `codex/companycore-connector-v1` to `open-jarvis/OpenJarvis` as
    `Wroblewski-Patryk`. The connector change was replayed on clean
    `origin/main`, validated with 6 targeted tests, and remains available as
    the documented OpenJarvis source handoff.

## Backlog

- Future v2 OAuth browser consent UI and token refresh hardening after core
  server-side API slices are complete.
- Future v2 dashboard surfaces that show ClickUp Lists, Drive folders/files,
  storage locations, knowledge roots, automations, and CompanyCore tables as
  one company operating area.
- Upstream OpenJarvis/Paperclip source merge execution and blocked GitHub
  auto-deploy webhook administration task.
