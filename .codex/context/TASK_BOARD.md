# TASK_BOARD

## Ready

- WEB-QA-001 Web language, message, and form foundation.
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Frontend Builder + QA/Test + Product Docs
  - Priority: P0
  - Source: `docs/planning/web-foundation-quality-audit-2026-05-16.md`
  - Goal: implement the next web-foundation quality slice before adding more
    departments: default English UI with a persistent language selector and
    Polish dictionary path, shared user-facing API error mapping, shared form
    field/validation primitives, and centralized notices/action feedback.
- DMS-NEXT-004 Relationships Management read packet and board.
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Product Docs + Backend Builder + Frontend Builder
  - Priority: P1
  - Source: `docs/planning/dms-13-systems-v1-implementation-audit.md`
  - Goal: implement the next post-Sales department slice for `05 Relacje` by
    creating a source-backed relationships/client-success context over
    clients, interactions, archived clients, satisfaction/feedback signals,
    relationship provenance, improvement opportunities, and blocked outreach
    or promise-making actions.
- DMS-NEXT-002 Differentiated department implementation slice.
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Product Docs + Frontend Builder + Backend Builder
  - Priority: P1
  - Source: `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-v1-blueprint.md`
  - Goal: select the next department implementation task using the
    differentiated-system contract. Recommended next runtime slice remains
    `03 Sales` read packet or board, but it must define Sales-specific
    pipeline/offer/follow-up/mobile states instead of copying a generic area
    panel.
- DMS-NEXT-001 Department systems user review and implementation sequence.
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Product Docs + Frontend Builder + Backend Builder
  - Priority: P1
  - Source: `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-v1-blueprint.md`
  - Goal: review the detailed `00 Main` plus 12-department blueprint with the
    owner, then create the first executable department-specific task contract.
    Recommended sequence after review: deepen `04 Operations`, then read-only
    `01 Strategy`, `03 Sales`, `05 Relationships`, and `02 Product And
    Delivery`.
- DMS-MIN-001 Global intake and Paperclip output review.
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Product Docs + Backend Builder + Frontend Builder
  - Priority: P1
  - Source: `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-v1-blueprint.md`
  - Goal: make `00 Main` the review/router for unclassified owner, client,
    provider, and Paperclip-created items before broad background automation.
    Start with a read-only review queue and classification/routing model.
## In Progress

- No active implementation task is currently in progress after the
  WEB-CORE-001 web surface cleanup checkpoint.

## Blocked

- AGRUN-010 Upstream Agent Source Merge Execution
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P2
  - Blocked by: external GitHub write access or an approved fork/PR route for
    Paperclip and OpenJarvis source handoff.
- CCV1-057B Paperclip upstream branch push
  - Stage: release
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P2
  - Blocked by: GitHub returned `403` for pushing
    `codex/companycore-adapter-v1` to `paperclipai/paperclip` as
    `Wroblewski-Patryk`. The adapter commit is validated locally and remains
    available as `4cfa476f` plus the managed CompanyCore patch.
- CCV1-058B OpenJarvis upstream branch push
  - Stage: release
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P2
  - Blocked by: GitHub returned `403` for pushing
    `codex/companycore-connector-v1` to `open-jarvis/OpenJarvis` as
    `Wroblewski-Patryk`. The connector change was replayed on clean
    `origin/main`, validated with 6 targeted tests, and remains available as
    the documented OpenJarvis source handoff.

  server-side API slices are complete.
- Future v2 dashboard surfaces that show ClickUp Lists, Drive folders/files,
  storage locations, knowledge roots, automations, and CompanyCore tables as
  one company operating area.
- Upstream OpenJarvis/Paperclip source merge execution and blocked GitHub
  auto-deploy webhook administration task.

## Done

- WEB-QA-AUDIT-001 Web foundation quality audit.
  - Evidence:
    `docs/planning/web-foundation-quality-audit-2026-05-16.md` audits the
    cleaned active web layer for route ownership, responsive readiness,
    form validation, error/notification behavior, language readiness,
    accessibility smoke, and scalable next implementation order. It records
    the base as production-testable but not ready for broad new department
    expansion until i18n, shared errors, shared forms, and notices are
    centralized. Task contract:
    `docs/planning/web-foundation-quality-audit-task-contract.md`.
  - Validation: source review of `web/src/main.tsx`,
    `web/src/app-route-registry.ts`, shared components, and `src/app.ts`;
    Playwright fallback against a temporary mocked API server on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3234`; `npm run build:web`; `npm run build:server`.
    Proof covered public home, native auth form validation, raw negative API
    error display, login redirect to `00 General`, `00/04/08` packet states,
    mobile `08 Assets` with no horizontal overflow, removed old route
    behavior, `html lang="en"`, and lack of a language switcher. The temporary
    server was closed and no validation-owned `chrome-headless-shell` process
    remained.

- WEB-CORE-001 Web core surface cleanup.
  - Evidence: `web/src/main.tsx` now renders only public home, owner login,
    owner registration, `00 General`, `04 Operations`, and `08 Assets`.
    `web/src/app-route-registry.ts` now exposes only the active route set plus
    compatibility aliases. `src/app.ts` no longer serves old private
    workbench paths as React app routes. Backend API files were not removed.
    Task contract:
    `docs/planning/web-core-surface-cleanup-task-contract.md`.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`; `npm run build:server`; Playwright proof
    against a temporary static React server covered `/`, `/auth/login`,
    login -> `/areas?area=00-ogolny&view=overview`, `/dashboard` alias,
    desktop `04 Operations`, desktop `08 Assets`, mobile `08 Assets` with no
    horizontal overflow, and removed `/settings/api` React-route behavior.
    `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only; port `3231` was
    closed and no validation-owned `chrome-headless-shell` process remained.

- CC-AUDIT-001 00/04/08 architecture and UX audit.
  - Evidence: `docs/planning/cc-00-04-08-architecture-ux-audit.md`
    records delivered scope and gaps for `00 Ogolny`, `04 Operations`, and
    `08 Assets`. `web/src/app-route-registry.ts` now makes
    `/areas?area=00-ogolny&view=overview` the canonical post-auth dashboard,
    preserves valid private query-string routes, and keeps `/dashboard` as a
    compatibility alias. `web/src/main.tsx` redirects `/dashboard` into
    `00 Ogolny` and points atlas/dashboard links there.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`; `npm run build:server`; Playwright
    fallback rendered login -> `00 Ogolny`, `/dashboard` -> `00 Ogolny`,
    desktop `04 Operations`, desktop `08 Assets`, and mobile `08 Assets`
    against a temporary static React server with mocked already-verified read
    packets. No console/page errors or mobile horizontal overflow were found.
    Screenshots: `docs/ux/evidence/cc-audit-001-post-login-00-dashboard.png`,
    `docs/ux/evidence/cc-audit-001-dashboard-alias-00.png`,
    `docs/ux/evidence/cc-audit-001-04-operations.png`,
    `docs/ux/evidence/cc-audit-001-08-assets-desktop.png`, and
    `docs/ux/evidence/cc-audit-001-08-assets-mobile.png`. `git diff --check`
    passed with line-ending warnings only; no validation-owned
    `chrome-headless-shell` process or port `3227` server remained.
- CC-UI-004 00/04/08 read-packet UI adoption.
  - Evidence: selected-area UI now consumes the verified read packets for
    `00 Main` route proposals, `04 Operations` work items, and `08 Assets`
    resources. The panels reuse shared `CcDataTable`/`CcButton` paths and keep
    writes blocked behind future command contracts.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`; Playwright rendered
    `/areas?area=00-ogolny&view=overview`,
    `/areas?area=04-operacje&view=overview`,
    `/areas?area=08-zasoby&view=overview`, and mobile `08 Assets` through a
    temporary local static server with mocked API packet responses for the
    already verified endpoints. No console/page errors or horizontal overflow
    were found. `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only; no
    validation-owned `chrome-headless-shell` process remained.

  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/cc-ui-004-00-04-08-read-packet-ui-adoption-task-contract.md`.

- CC-08-002 Assets context read API.
  - Evidence: `GET /v1/assets/context` now exposes a protected read-only
    `08 Assets` packet over Drive files/folders, content snapshots, Resource
    records, Knowledge Roots, Knowledge Items, operating-area scope, resource
    taxonomy, AI-readiness labels, relations, cleanup summary, and blocked
    provider actions. It is exposed through `assets:read` and MCP as a
    read-risk tool.
  - Validation: `npm run build:server`; `npm run test:api` against disposable
    PostgreSQL on `127.0.0.1:55500`; validation-owned PostgreSQL stopped and
    port closed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/cc-08-002-assets-context-read-api-task-contract.md`.

- CC-04-002 Operations task read model v1.
  - Evidence: `GET /v1/operations/work-items` now exposes a protected
    read-only Operations work item packet over current tasks, hierarchy,
    pipeline/stage/procedure evidence, dependencies, notes, events, agent log
    evidence, project resources, scoped Operations Drive files, readiness gaps,
    and blocked actions. It is exposed through `operations:read` and MCP as a
    read-risk tool.
  - Validation: `npm run build:server`; `npm run test:api` against disposable
    PostgreSQL on `127.0.0.1:55499`; validation-owned PostgreSQL stopped and
    port closed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/cc-04-002-operations-work-item-read-model-task-contract.md`.

- CC-00-002 Route proposal lifecycle readback API.
  - Evidence: `GET /v1/intake/route-proposals` now exposes read-only route
    proposal lifecycle state from current `Decision`, optional `Task`,
    `AuditLog`, and `Event` records. The route is available under
    `intake:read`, appears in the MCP manifest as a read-risk tool, and
    returns proposal evidence, effects, blocked actions, summary, and
    read-only agent packet without acknowledging events, mutating providers,
    approving proposals, discounting, invoicing, deleting, or executing
    commercial/legal actions.
  - Validation: `npm run build:server`; `npm run test:api` against disposable
    PostgreSQL on `127.0.0.1:55498`; validation-owned PostgreSQL stopped and
    port closed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/cc-00-002-route-proposal-lifecycle-readback-api-task-contract.md`.

- CC-UI-003 Shared data table/list primitive.
  - Evidence: `web/src/components/cc-data-table.tsx` adds `CcDataTable` with
    loading, empty, error, density, pagination-ready controls, row actions,
    and optional mobile card behavior. `web/src/react-route-kit.tsx` keeps the
    existing `DataTable` export as a compatibility wrapper over the new
    primitive.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`; `npx tsx -e` static render check;
    Playwright local `/auth/login` route smoke with no console/page errors and
    no horizontal overflow; `git diff --check`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/cc-ui-003-shared-data-table-list-primitive-task-contract.md`.

- CC-UI-002 Shared action/button primitive.
  - Evidence: `web/src/components/cc-button.tsx` adds `CcButton` over DaisyUI
    `btn` with variants, size, icons, loading, disabled reason, href/button
    behavior, and accessible labels. `web/src/react-route-kit.tsx` and
    `web/src/main.tsx` adopt it in the shared notice and generic state panel.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`; `npx tsx -e` static render check;
    Playwright local `/auth/login` route smoke with no console/page errors and
    no horizontal overflow; `git diff --check`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/cc-ui-002-shared-action-button-primitive-task-contract.md`.

- CC-UI-001 Shared component inventory for CompanyCore management UI.
  - Evidence: `docs/planning/cc-ui-001-shared-component-inventory.md`
    records current Shell, notice/state, table, card, button, badge, tab, and
    form reuse/gaps from `web/src/main.tsx`, `web/src/react-route-kit.tsx`,
    and `web/src/styles.css`. It defines the next shared primitives:
    `CcButton`, `CcDataTable`, `CcStatePanel`, `CcCard`, `CcBadge`,
    `CcTabs`, `CcField`, and `CcToolbar`.
  - Validation: `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/cc-ui-001-shared-component-inventory-task-contract.md`.

- CC-00-001 Route proposal lifecycle readback plan.
  - Evidence:
    `docs/planning/cc-00-001-route-proposal-lifecycle-readback-plan.md`
    maps current intake route proposals to `Decision`, optional `Task`,
    `AuditLog`, and `Event` readback, lifecycle states, UI requirements,
    API/MCP constraints, and blocked actions.
  - Validation: `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/cc-00-001-route-proposal-lifecycle-readback-task-contract.md`.

- CC-04-001 Operations task model gap audit.
  - Evidence:
    `docs/planning/cc-04-001-operations-task-model-gap-audit.md` compares the
    owner target Operations task model with current Task, Project, TaskList,
    Pipeline, Stage, Procedure, Operations context, and UI coverage, and
    recommends `CC-04-002` as a read-model-first runtime slice.
  - Validation: `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/cc-04-001-operations-task-model-gap-audit-task-contract.md`.

- CC-08-001 Assets/resource system spec.
  - Evidence:
    `docs/planning/cc-08-001-assets-resource-system-spec.md` defines the first
    `08 Assets` board, resource taxonomy, AI-readiness labels, desktop/tablet/
    mobile layout, blocked provider actions, and agent packet over existing
    Google Drive, Resource, and knowledge foundations.
  - Validation: `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/cc-08-001-assets-resource-system-spec-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-03-006 Sales Management context and board.
  - Evidence:
    Protected read-only `GET /v1/sales/context` now returns the `03-sprzedaz`
    Sales Management packet over clients, deals, stages, interactions,
    follow-up work, notes, commercial exceptions, current-client work, Drive
    evidence, and Finance handoff context. The route is exposed through
    `sales:read`, MCP manifest tooling, and read-oriented MCP key profiles.
    `/areas?area=03-sprzedaz&view=overview` renders the dedicated Sales
    Management board from that packet while quote, discount, invoice, ad, and
    autonomous outreach writes remain blocked.
  - Validation:
    `npm run build:server`; `npm run build:web`; `npm run test:api` against
    validation-owned PostgreSQL on `127.0.0.1:55497`; Playwright desktop and
    mobile proof on `http://127.0.0.1:3220` with no console/page errors or
    horizontal overflow.
  - Evidence:
    `docs/ux/evidence/dms-03-sales-board-desktop.png` and
    `docs/ux/evidence/dms-03-sales-board-mobile.png`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-03-sales-context-and-board-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-V1-006 13 Department Systems V1 Implementation Audit.
  - Evidence:
    `docs/planning/dms-13-systems-v1-implementation-audit.md` maps `00 Main`
    plus all 12 operating department systems to current backend foundations,
    current web readiness, V1 desktop/mobile expectations, missing backend
    gaps, Paperclip boundaries, blocked actions, and first implementation
    slices. The audit names `03 Sales` as the recommended next read-packet
    slice while keeping high-risk writes blocked.
  - Validation:
    source review and `git diff --check`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-13-systems-v1-implementation-audit-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-V1-005 Differentiated Department Management Systems Analysis.
  - Evidence:
    The DMS architecture now states that the 12 operating departments share
    CompanyCore shell, auth, evidence, MCP, and safety primitives, but each
    department must have its own management board, workflow vocabulary,
    desktop UX, mobile attention queue, state model, source records, and
    Paperclip boundaries. The UX map defines department-specific board
    requirements for Strategy, Product/Delivery, Sales, Operations,
    Relationships, People/Agents, Finance, Assets, Technology/AI, Legal,
    Innovation, and Executive.
  - Validation:
    source review and `git diff --check`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-differentiated-department-systems-analysis-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-01-005B Production Strategy Context Smoke.
  - Evidence:
    Manual VPS rollover deployed commit
    `5db4dd8b1fe9058d1fc78ebc957c0716ebd4822a`. Production now runs
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-5db4dd8`; previous backend
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-9ff1882` is retained stopped as
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-9ff1882-previous-5db4dd8`.
    Public web/API health returned the expected commit. Protected
    `/v1/strategy/context` returned `01-strategia`, `strategy-governance`,
    `summary.activeMetrics=1`, `summary.activeRisks=1`,
    `agentPacket.mode=read_only`, and `blockedActions=4`.
  - Validation:
    canary local health, final local health, public web/API health, protected
    owner-auth route smoke, and local/VPS rollout artifact cleanup.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-strategy-production-smoke-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-01-005A Strategy Management System Read Packet API.
  - Evidence:
    Protected read-only `GET /v1/strategy/context` now returns the
    `01-strategia` Strategy Management packet with goals, targets, metrics,
    risks/controls, decision logs, decisions, strategic knowledge, Drive
    documents, tasks, summary counts, and a read-only agent handoff. The route
    is exposed through `strategy:read`, MCP manifest tooling, and read-oriented
    MCP key profiles.
  - Validation:
    `npm run build:server`; `npm run test:api` with validation-owned
    PostgreSQL on `127.0.0.1:55496`; `git diff --check`; validation
    PostgreSQL and temporary artifacts cleaned up.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-strategy-context-read-api-task-contract.md`.

- V1OPS-005 Production Operations Context Smoke.
  - Evidence:
    Manual VPS rollover deployed commit
    `9ff18820cb00bb2164904b947c2ef2a48e5d3b14`. Production now runs
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-9ff1882`; previous backend
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-5f1fc71` is retained stopped as
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-5f1fc71-previous-9ff1882`.
    Public web/API health returned the expected commit. Protected
    `/v1/operations/context` returned `04-operacje`,
    `operations-administration`, `summary.procedures=7`,
    `agentPacket.mode=read_only`, and `blockedActions=4`.
  - Validation:
    canary local health, final local health, public web/API health, protected
    owner-auth route smoke, and local/VPS rollout artifact cleanup.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1ops-production-operations-context-smoke-task-contract.md`.

- V1OPS-004 V1 Operations Context Read API.
  - Evidence:
    Protected read-only `GET /v1/operations/context` now returns the
    `04-operacje` Operations Management packet with procedures, procedure
    steps, approvals, dependencies, business functions, operational tasks,
    summary counts, and read-only agent handoff. The route is exposed through
    `operations:read`, MCP manifest tooling, and read-oriented MCP key
    profiles.
  - Validation:
    `npm run build:server`; `npm run test:api` with validation-owned
    PostgreSQL on `127.0.0.1:55495`; `git diff --check`; validation
    PostgreSQL and temporary artifacts cleaned up.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-operations-context-read-api-task-contract.md`.

- V1OPS-003 V1 Operations Compatibility Alias Cleanup.
  - Evidence:
    `src/operating-model/department-registry.ts` now centralizes canonical
    `00`-`12` department keys, backend area keys, aliases, and intake hint
    terms. AOG selected-area reads resolve `03-sprzedaz` to `sales-crm` and
    `07-finanse` to `finance-billing` before numeric fallback. Global intake
    suggestions use canonical department keys and scored hints so finance-heavy
    Paperclip/pricing signals route to `07-finanse`, while generic signals
    fall back to `00-ogolny`.
  - Validation:
    `npm run build:server`; `npm run test:api` with validation-owned
    PostgreSQL on `127.0.0.1:55494`; `git diff --check`; validation
    PostgreSQL and temporary artifacts cleaned up.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-operations-compatibility-alias-cleanup-task-contract.md`.

- V1OPS-002 Production V1 smoke after Company OS area foundation.
  - Evidence:
    Production was manually rolled over to commit
    `5f1fc71e44d09cb1780d29b2579c85023205efb9` with running container
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-5f1fc71`; previous backend
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-d2c9b94` is retained stopped as
    rollback. Public web/API `/health` returned `200` with the expected commit
    and image. Authenticated production smoke verified `/operations`,
    `/tasks-adapter`, `/data`, `/areas?area=04-operacje&view=overview`,
    `/settings/drive`, and `/react-company-os?area=04-operacje`; direct AOG
    smoke returned `strategy-governance` with `27` nodes and `32` edges.
  - Validation: `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, VPS canary health,
    public health, authenticated desktop/mobile Playwright proof, no
    console/page errors, no non-font failed requests, no horizontal overflow,
    remote/local rollout artifact cleanup, and no leftover validation browser
    processes.
  - Evidence directory:
    `docs/ux/evidence/production-v1-5f1fc71-2026-05-16/`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-production-smoke-rollout-task-contract.md`.

- V1COS-001 Company OS Area-Aware V1 Foundation.
  - Evidence:
    `/react-company-os` now renders a department control map that connects
    Company OS governance/runtime evidence to the `00`-`12` department
    management systems. The selected department shows subsystem purpose,
    mapped backend tables, agent handoff, first safe action, and blocked
    actions while preserving the existing Company OS command and evidence
    panels.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`, `git diff --check`, embedded PostgreSQL
    migration deploy on `127.0.0.1:55483`, and Playwright real-backend proof
    on `http://127.0.0.1:3219/react-company-os?area=04-operacje`. The proof
    registered a fresh owner, verified Operations, clicked `06`, verified
    `People/Agents And Role Management System`, and found no console/page
    errors or horizontal overflow. Validation backend and PostgreSQL were
    stopped.

    `docs/planning/v1-company-os-area-foundation-task-contract.md`.

- PROD-GDRIVE-002 Production Google Drive changes baseline.
  - Evidence:
    `POST /v1/integration-settings/google_drive/changes/reconcile` now
    initializes a missing Drive changes page token through
    `changes/startPageToken`, stores it, emits existing reconcile evidence, and
    returns `baselineInitialized=true` with zero processed changes. Production
    was manually rolled over to commit
    `d2c9b9460a5db63703ca28f98988a2fa35d3a651`; public API/web health report
    that commit. First protected production reconcile returned `200` with
    `baselineInitialized=true` and stored `newStartPageToken=25137`; second
    reconcile returned `200` through the stored-token path. Drive index stayed
    `754` total with `0` unassigned, `0` pending, `0` failed, and `0` trashed.
  - Validation: `npm run build:server`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm run test:api` passed against portable PostgreSQL on
    `127.0.0.1:55490`; manual VPS canary and production rollover passed;
    temporary VPS env/source/rollout files were removed. Previous backend was
    retained stopped as rollback container
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-000111041002-previous-d2c9b94`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/prod-google-drive-changes-baseline-task-contract.md`.

- PROD-GDRIVE-001 Production Google Drive Index And Paperclip Access Audit.
  - Evidence:
    Production Google Drive index was repaired through protected API routes.
    The selected 13 Drive roots now have no missing create candidates in
    `inspect_only`; `/v1/google-drive/files` reports `754` indexed records,
    `0` unassigned, `0` pending, `0` failed, and `0` trashed. Six unassigned
    records encountered during the audit were assigned by parent folder scope.
    MCP manifest exposes 15 Google Drive tools, and the active Paperclip Tools
    production bridge has Google Drive read/write/scope/import/reconcile
    scopes. Follow-up Paperclip runtime proof confirmed the bridge is
    configured in Paperclip `company_core_settings`: knowledge-key calls to
    `/v1/connection`, `/v1/mcp/manifest`, and `/v1/google-drive/files`
    returned `200`; tools-key calls to `/v1/connection` and
    `/v1/google-drive/files` returned `200`; and Paperclip has 1282
    CompanyCore tool assignments across 36 agents, including 12 distinct
    Google Drive tools.
  - Validation: production API/web health checks returned `200`; production
    Drive `inspect_only` returned `wouldCreateCount=0`; MCP manifest readback
    returned 146 tools. `changes/reconcile` returned `422 sync_failed`, so
    changes-polling freshness remains a follow-up rather than a completed
    proof.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/production-google-drive-index-paperclip-access-audit-task-contract.md`.

- V1REL-001 Area relationship provenance review.

    `FinanceManagementBoard` from `GET /v1/finance/context`, including pricing
    candidates, hourly value, commercial exceptions, invoice blockers, source
    conflicts, and blocked finance actions.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`, `git diff --check`, and Playwright proof
    on `http://127.0.0.1:3213` for desktop/mobile Finance board. No
    console/page errors or horizontal overflow were observed. Validation
    backend and PostgreSQL were stopped.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-07-finance-web-board-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-SHELL-003 Department Data Backbone.

    `web/src/main.tsx` now renders `DepartmentDataBackbone` inside the shared
    department shell, using existing operating graph status, table/record
    context, Drive/source count, and review gaps with fallback text.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`, `git diff --check`, and Playwright proof
    on `http://127.0.0.1:3212` for `01-strategia`, `07-finanse`, and
    `12-zarzadzanie` on desktop/mobile. No console/page errors or horizontal
    overflow were observed. Validation backend and PostgreSQL were stopped.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-shell-003-department-data-backbone-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-00-007 Paperclip Background Output Review Proof.
  - Evidence:

    records the verified loop from Paperclip-like `AgentEventOutbox` to
    `GET /v1/intake`, `POST /v1/intake/actions/propose-route`, proposal
    `Decision`/`AuditLog`/`Event`/optional `Task`, and unchanged source
    delivery status.
  - Validation: existing API regression coverage in `src/tests/api.test.ts`
    passed again during the DMS-07-002 gate with `npm run test:api` against
    portable PostgreSQL on `127.0.0.1:55482`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-00-paperclip-background-output-review-proof-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-07-002 Finance Context Read API.
  - Evidence:
    `src/modules/finance/finance.routes.ts` implements protected read-only
    `GET /v1/finance/context`, reusing commercial exception context and
    exposing candidate pricing models, hourly-value assumptions, work
    valuations, invoice-readiness blockers, payment source context, finance
    risks, source conflicts, agent packet, and blocked actions.
  - Validation: `npm run build:server`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm run test:api` passed against portable PostgreSQL on
    `127.0.0.1:55482`. The API test covers auth, scoped-key denial, MCP
    exposure, candidate pricing conflicts, `150 CHF/hour`, `100%` exception
    inclusion, invoice blockers, workspace isolation, and no mutation on read.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-07-finance-context-read-api-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-03-005A Commercial Exception Read API.
  - Evidence:
    `src/modules/commercial-exceptions/commercial-exceptions.routes.ts`
    implements protected read-only `GET /v1/commercial-exceptions`; the route
    is mounted in `src/app.ts`, exposed through
    `commercial-exceptions:read`, included in MCP manifests and agent key
    profiles, and documented in `docs/API.md`.
  - Validation: `npm run build:server`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm run test:api` passed against portable PostgreSQL on
    `127.0.0.1:55481`. The API test covers unauthenticated denial, scoped-key
    denial, MCP exposure, workspace isolation, no mutation on read, `100%`
    discount packet values, missing-source status, and blocked actions.
  - Task contract:

    blueprint, current Prisma foundations, and `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-03-commercial-exception-read-model-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-07-001 Finance System Spec.
  - Evidence:
    `docs/planning/dms-07-finance-system-spec.md` defines the
    `07 Finance And Billing Management System` V1 board, first safe web
    shape, protected read-only `GET /v1/finance/context` target, pricing model
    packet, hourly-value assumptions, work valuation, commercial exceptions,
    invoice-readiness blockers, owner decisions, Paperclip packet, and blocked
    invoice/payment/discount/autonomous-pricing actions.
  - Validation: source review of DMS blueprint, pricing inventory, global
    plan, current code references, and `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-07-finance-system-spec-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-SHELL-002 Department Subsystem Registry.
  - Evidence: `web/src/main.tsx` now defines a typed registry for all `00`-`12`
    department systems and renders `DepartmentSubsystemRegistry` inside the
    shared shell. Each department has system name, value role, owner question,
    first safe action, agent handoff, blocked actions, and three subsystem
    cards. `web/src/styles.css` adds the shared registry styling.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web` and `git diff --check` passed.
    Playwright real-backend proof on `http://127.0.0.1:3211` verified
    `01-strategia`, `06-kadry`, `07-finanse`, and `12-zarzadzanie`, with no
    console errors or horizontal overflow. Temporary validation backend and
    PostgreSQL processes were stopped.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-shell-002-department-subsystem-registry-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-00-006 First Safe Global Intake Route Command.
  - Evidence: `POST /v1/intake/actions/propose-route` now validates source
    allowlist, workspace ownership, canonical department keys, and idempotency;
    creates proposal evidence through `Decision`, `AuditLog`, `Event`, and
    optional `Task`; exposes `intake:write` in capabilities/MCP; and adds a
    `Propose route` action to the `00 Main` web panel.
  - Validation: `npm run build:server`, `npm run build:web`, and
    `npm run test:api` passed with
    `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1:55480/postgres`.
    Playwright browser proof on `http://127.0.0.1:3210` created a route
    proposal from `/areas?area=00-ogolny&view=overview`, found no console
    errors or horizontal overflow, and confirmed the source agent event
    remained `pending`. Temporary validation backend and PostgreSQL processes
    were stopped.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-00-global-intake-route-command-task-contract.md`.

  - Validation: source review of the current intake route and command-shaped
    CompanyCore patterns; `git diff --check` passed.
  - Next task: DMS-00-006 first safe global intake route/classification
    command.

- DMS-SHELL-001 Shared Department Management Shell.
  - Evidence: `web/src/main.tsx` now renders selected-area department views
    through `DepartmentManagementShell`, with `DepartmentImprovementLoop` as a
    shared zone for feedback, defects, standards, and next work. `00 Main` and
    `04 Operations` keep their dedicated special panels inside the shared
    shell. `web/src/react-route-kit.tsx` now uses unique shell navigation keys
    for duplicate route hrefs across route groups.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web` and `git diff --check` passed. Playwright
    static SPA proof on `http://127.0.0.1:3206` verified desktop
    `/areas?area=01-strategia&view=overview`,
    `/areas?area=04-operacje&view=overview`,
    `/areas?area=00-ogolny&view=overview`, and mobile
    `/areas?area=04-operacje&view=overview`; required shell/intake/operations
    markers were present, there was no horizontal overflow, and console/page
    errors were empty. Temporary validation ports `3204`, `3205`, and `3206`
    were stopped after proof.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-shell-001-shared-department-management-shell-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-MONEY-001 Pricing/Hourly-Value/Discount Source Inventory.
  - Evidence:
    `docs/planning/dms-money-pricing-discount-source-inventory.md` inventories
    Drive-backed pricing and client sources, separates conflicting commercial
    models, records the 100 percent discount case as a required commercial
    exception, maps current CompanyCore reuse, and lists backend gaps for
    service offers, pricing models, labor rates, estimates, discount policies,
    invoice drafts, and archived-client learning.
  - Validation: Google Drive connector search/fetch reviewed `Business plan`,
    the Swiss pricing benchmark, `2. Zalozenia`, and related offer/project
    pointers. Repo source review covered Prisma clients/deals/interactions,
    API docs, intake tests, and ClickUp/Drive adapter foundations. Direct
    ClickUp source review is blocked because no callable ClickUp search/read
    tool was exposed in this session. `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-money-pricing-discount-source-inventory-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-00-004 Global Intake Web Panel.
  - Evidence: `/areas?area=00-ogolny&view=overview` now renders a dedicated
    `00 Main Management System` panel over the verified `/v1/intake` API. The
    panel shows read-only intake/MCP readiness, summary counts, quick filters,
    owner decision, Paperclip/agent, unassigned-resource, and risk/blocker
    queues, plus a routing packet that only changes existing selected-area
    views.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web` and `npm run build:server` passed.
    Playwright real-backend proof on `http://127.0.0.1:3192` logged in the
    seeded owner, verified desktop and mobile route markers, clicked the panel
    `Tasks` control to `/areas?area=00-ogolny&view=tasks`, and reported no
    console errors, no framework overlay, and no horizontal overflow. Browser
    plugin invocation was attempted first and fell back to Playwright because
    no active Codex browser pane was available.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-00-global-intake-web-panel-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-00-003 Global Intake Read API.
  - Evidence: protected `GET /v1/intake` now aggregates existing
    AgentEventOutbox, ProviderEventInbox, GoogleDriveFile,
    ExternalContainerMapping, ExternalFieldMapping, Approval, Risk, Task, and
    Event records into one read-only `00 Main` intake queue with normalized
    family, status, risk, suggested department, evidence, allowed action, and
    blocked action metadata. `intake:read` is exposed through capabilities,
    adapter manifest, MCP manifest, and MCP-oriented agent key profiles.
  - Validation: `npm run build:server` passed. `npm run test:api` passed
    against workspace-local PostgreSQL on `127.0.0.1:55476` using the existing
    `postgres` database. `npm run typecheck` is not available in
    `package.json`. API regression coverage was added in `src/tests/api.test.ts`
    for authentication, workspace isolation, Paperclip filtering, provider
    failures, unassigned resources, high-risk rows, MCP exposure, and no
    mutation on read.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-00-global-intake-read-api-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-00-002 Intake Source Audit.
  - Evidence:
    `docs/planning/dms-00-intake-source-audit.md` maps current CompanyCore
    sources into DMS-00 intake families and confirms the first read-only
    aggregate can be implemented without a migration. It selects top-level
    `GET /v1/intake` and lists DMS-00-003 implementation files/tests.
  - Validation: code/schema source review and `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-00-intake-source-audit-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-00-001 Global Intake And Paperclip Output Review Contract.
  - Evidence:

    intake candidate families, review statuses, priority/risk/agent-authority
    vocabulary, intake row and summary shapes, proposed backend/MCP surfaces,
    `00 Main` web panel requirements, routing heuristics, and future write
    guardrails.
  - Validation: source review and `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/dms-00-global-intake-paperclip-review-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-V1-000 V1 Department Systems Global Implementation Plan.
  - Evidence:
    `docs/planning/v1-department-systems-global-implementation-plan.md` now
    defines the full V1 execution program for web, backend, Paperclip,
    department shells, all department systems, pricing/discounts, archived
    clients, feedback, QA, production smoke, and closeout.
  - Validation: source-of-truth review and `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-department-systems-global-implementation-plan-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-BLUEPRINT-001 Department Management Systems V1 Blueprint.
  - Evidence: `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-v1-blueprint.md`
    now defines the shared department contract, shared web layout, backend
    reuse rules, backend expansion principles, `00 Main` orchestration, all
    12 operating department systems, implementation waves, recommended build
    order, backend gap register, acceptance criteria for future department
    specs, and guardrails for high-risk finance/legal/ads/AI writes.
  - Validation: source-of-truth review and `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/department-management-systems-v1-blueprint-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-OPS-001 04 Operations Management System V1 Read Model.
  - Evidence: `/areas?area=04-operacje&view=overview` now renders a dedicated
    Operations Management System board as the first management surface for
    authenticated owners. The board derives planning, routines, controls,
    dependencies, approvals, business functions, and AI handoff signals from
    existing selected-area tables and links to existing Company OS, agent
    tools, and API scope routes. The shared table-record loader now treats
    Company OS collections as readable when the owner has `company-os:read`,
    so department tables backed by `/v1/company-os/:collection` load real
    records instead of false zero-count states.
  - Validation: `npm run build`, `npm run build:web`, and `git diff --check`
    passed. Playwright authenticated mocked-owner proof verified
    desktop/mobile markers and no horizontal overflow, with screenshots in
    `docs/ux/evidence/dms-ops-management-system-desktop.png` and
    `docs/ux/evidence/dms-ops-management-system-mobile.png`. Playwright
    real-backend proof on `http://127.0.0.1:3214` registered an owner, seeded
    real Company OS records for business function, procedure, procedure step,
    approval, and dependency, and verified `/areas?area=04-operacje&view=overview`
    on desktop/mobile with screenshots in
    `docs/ux/evidence/dms-ops-real-data-desktop.png` and
    `docs/ux/evidence/dms-ops-real-data-mobile.png`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/operations-management-system-v1-task-contract.md`.

- V1DATA-001 Evidence browser V1 workbench.
  - Evidence: `/data` and `/data/:table` now render a V1 foundation evidence
    browser with department record metrics, agent-readable table context,
    empty-table and review-gap signals, selected-table owner/API/capability
    context, department coverage links, and generic record inspection.
    `/data` is marked `v1-foundation` in `web/src/app-route-registry.ts`.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web` passed. Playwright real-backend proof on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3215` registered an owner, seeded Company OS evidence
    records, and verified desktop `/data` plus mobile `/data/procedures` with
    no console/page errors or horizontal overflow. Screenshots:
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-data-evidence-browser-desktop.png` and
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-data-evidence-browser-mobile.png`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-data-evidence-browser-task-contract.md`.

- DMS-ARCH-001 Department Management Systems Architecture And V1 View Map.
  - Evidence: `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-architecture.md`
    defines each 00-12 Company Atlas area as a department management system
    over shared CompanyCore tables, pipelines, tasks, knowledge, resources,
    metrics, decisions, governance, and AI/MCP tools.
    `docs/ux/v1-department-management-systems-view-map.md` lists public,
    private, support workbench, and all 13 department system routes.
    `docs/ux/v1-department-system-prompt-pack.md` provides reusable prompts
    for UX specs, visual concepts, implementation plans, and Paperclip/AI
    packets.
  - Validation: source-of-truth review and `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/department-management-systems-architecture-task-contract.md`.

- V1TASKS-001 Tasks and Delivery V1 workbench.
  - Evidence: `/tasks-adapter` is now a V1 canonical route that loads
    workspace, task, Company OS, and MCP context; shows execution pressure,
    department delivery-table coverage, AI handoff readiness, all-task
    filters, inline task creation, and quick task status movement through
    existing protected task routes.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`, `npm run validate`, `npm run test:api`,
    and `git diff --check` passed against workspace-local PostgreSQL on
    `127.0.0.1:55476`. Real backend Playwright proof on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3162/tasks-adapter` registered a fresh owner, created
    `Proof delivery task`, moved it to `in_progress`, verified success states,
    and captured desktop/mobile screenshots with no horizontal overflow:
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-tasks-delivery-real-backend-desktop.png` and
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-tasks-delivery-real-backend-mobile.png`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-tasks-delivery-workbench-task-contract.md`.

- ORG-FLOW-001 CompanyCore Global Business Flow.
  - Evidence: `docs/architecture/companycore-global-business-flow.md` defines
    one 13-stage company value pipeline for products, services, and hybrid
    delivery from strategic intent, brand, demand, lead qualification,
    discovery, offer/agreement, delivery planning, execution,
    quality/acceptance, payment, support, feedback, and improvement back to
    next intent. It includes a dependency tree, stage contracts,
    operating-area mapping, relationship model, AI/MCP guardrails, metrics,
    visualization levels, and future implementation candidates.
  - Validation: source-of-truth review and `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/companycore-global-business-flow-task-contract.md`.

- V1OPS-001 Operations Cockpit React view.
  - Evidence: `/operations` is served by the React app, registered as a V1
    canonical command route, and aggregates existing owner contracts for
    workspace connection, clients, tasks, Google Drive files, agents, agent
    events, Company OS, and table record snapshots. The route includes client
    and task quick-create forms, department file/table evidence, area coverage,
    owner direction queue, and AI-agent handoff/readiness context.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`, `npm run build`, `npm run validate`, and
    `npm run test:api` passed against workspace-local PostgreSQL on
    `127.0.0.1:55476`. Real backend Playwright proof on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3161/operations` registered a fresh owner, rendered the
    four cockpit lanes, created a proof client and proof task, verified success
    states, and captured desktop/mobile screenshots with no horizontal
    overflow:
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-operations-cockpit-real-backend-desktop.png` and
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-operations-cockpit-real-backend-mobile.png`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-operations-cockpit-task-contract.md`.

- AOG-BE-001 Area operating graph read API.
  - Evidence: `GET /v1/operating-graph/areas/:areaKey` is implemented in
    `src/modules/operating-graph/operating-graph.routes.ts`, mounted in
    `src/app.ts`, exposed through `operating-graph:read` in capabilities and
    MCP manifest, consumed by selected-area React fallback logic, documented in
    `docs/API.md`, and covered in `src/tests/api.test.ts`.
  - Validation: `npm run test:api` passed against workspace-local PostgreSQL
    on `127.0.0.1:55476`, including build, migrations, protected API flow,
    AOG regressions, MCP exposure, and Google Drive OAuth refresh regression.
    `npm run validate` and `git diff --check` also passed in this mission.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/aog-be-001-area-operating-graph-read-api-task-contract.md`.

- V1SETTINGS-002 Unified settings React implementation.
  - Evidence: `/settings`, `/settings/integrations`, `/settings/drive`,
    `/settings/api`, and `/react-agent-tools` now render one
    `UnifiedSettingsRoute` with sections for Integrations, Agent keys, and
    MCP. Integrations expose ClickUp and Google Drive provider rows, direct
    active/disabled switches, Setup/Mapping/Sync tabs, backend-backed
    credential and scope fields, `syncMode`, `importMode`, provider discovery,
    mapping, and sync/import/reconcile actions through existing contracts.
    `web/src/app-route-registry.ts` now marks settings entry routes as V1
    canonical and prevents `/settings` from resolving as the old ClickUp
    bridge route.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`, `npm run validate`, `git diff --check`,
    and `npm run test:api` passed. Playwright fallback with mocked owner API
    verified desktop `/settings` Mapping and mobile `/settings/drive` Sync.
    A real backend Playwright proof on `http://127.0.0.1:3160` registered an
    owner, opened `/settings`, saved Google Drive OAuth client credentials from
    `/settings/drive`, read back `oauthClientConfigured=true` from
    `/v1/integration-settings/google_drive`, and captured desktop/mobile
    screenshots:
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-settings-unified-proof-desktop.png`,
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-settings-unified-proof-mobile.png`,
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-settings-real-backend-desktop.png`,
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-settings-drive-save-real-backend-desktop.png`, and
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-settings-real-backend-mobile.png`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-settings-react-implementation-task-contract.md`.

- REACT-WEB-002 ClickUp setup React workflow.
  - Evidence: closed by V1SETTINGS-002. ClickUp setup, token preservation,
    team/list/space/folder IDs, discovery, area mapping, maintenance run, and
    task sync controls now live inside the unified V1 settings Integrations
    section instead of a ClickUp-only root settings route.
  - Validation: covered by V1SETTINGS-002 build and Playwright proof.

- REACT-WEB-003 Google Drive OAuth/folder-selection React workflow.
  - Evidence: closed by V1SETTINGS-002 for the settings-scope portion. Google
    Drive client credentials, root/shared/selected folder IDs,
    `changesPageToken`, sync policy, folder discovery, folder-area mapping,
    import, and reconcile controls now live inside the unified V1 settings
    Integrations section. Existing imported CompanyCore data remains available
    when the provider is disabled.
  - Validation: covered by V1SETTINGS-002 build and Playwright proof.

- ORG-MOD-001 CompanyCore Business Module Map.
  - Evidence: `docs/architecture/companycore-business-module-map.md` now
    defines CompanyCore as the bridge for operating the company through
    canonical modules for company graph, goals, work/tasks,
    processes/pipelines, runtime evidence, knowledge, storage/documents, CRM,
    resources, integrations, agents/MCP, governance, and metrics. Future work
    must classify modules as native core, provider-backed, future adapter, or
    derived view before adding schema, UI, API, MCP, or provider-specific
    behavior.
  - Validation: `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/companycore-business-module-map-task-contract.md`.

- V1PROD-003 Authenticated V1 production parity and selected-area data match.
  - Evidence: commit `1dafe910ff612e027b686f09e2a488600f6e60d4`
    was pushed and deployed through the accepted manual VPS rollover path.
    Public web/API `/health` report image
    `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:1dafe91`. Authenticated production
    Playwright proof verified `/dashboard`,
    `/areas?area=01-strategia&view=overview`, and
    `/areas?area=01-strategia&view=ai` on desktop/mobile with no horizontal
    overflow, no console errors, no failed requests, and no empty unmatched
    backend-area state. `01 Strategia` now resolves backend operating context
    with `8 TABLES`, Drive evidence, and provider mappings.
  - Validation: `npm run validate`, `git diff --check`, VPS Docker image
    build, canary health, final routed container health, public web/API health,
    and authenticated production screenshot proof passed.
  - Evidence directory:
    `docs/ux/evidence/production-auth-v1-1dafe91-2026-05-15/`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-production-authenticated-parity-task-contract.md`.

- PAPERCLIP-ARCH-001 Paperclip Company-Building Architecture Direction.
  - Evidence: `docs/architecture/organizational-architecture-bridge.md` now
    records Paperclip as a supervised external company-building execution
    agent over CompanyCore, with the minimal loop `business plan / owner
    intent -> knowledge and operating graph -> gap and task analysis -> work
    items -> execution -> feedback/evidence/next gaps`.
    `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md` now defines agent-facing
    Knowledge, Tools, Access, and Audit layers over the existing API/MCP
    boundary.
  - Validation: `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/paperclip-company-building-architecture-task-contract.md`.

- V1PROD-002 Deploy V1 canonical web layer and rerun parity.
  - Evidence: commit `ff5e04192db93a53280fab58bcd8f47cba30f554` was pushed to
    `origin/codex/companycore-local-port-3102` and deployed through the
    approved manual VPS rollover path. Public web/API `/health` report
    `ff5e04192db93a53280fab58bcd8f47cba30f554` and image
    `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:ff5e041`. Production `/` now serves the
    V1 public home; `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` serve V1 public auth
    layouts; signed-out `/dashboard` and selected-area routes redirect to
    login.
  - Validation: `npm run validate`, `git diff --check`, Docker image build,
    canary local health, public web/API health, and production Playwright
    desktop/mobile screenshot proof passed. `npm run test:api` was not run
    because local Docker commands timed out; no migration or backend API
    contract changed in this release.
  - Evidence directory:
    `docs/ux/evidence/production-v1-ff5e041-2026-05-15/`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-production-canonical-deploy-task-contract.md`.
  - Residual risk: authenticated production dashboard and selected-area visual
    parity still needs an owner-session screenshot pass.

- V1PROD-001 Production Canonical Parity Audit.
  - Evidence: production screenshots and route report were captured under
    `docs/ux/evidence/production-compare-2026-05-15/`. Public web/API health
    reported `build.commit="b716f02"` while the current V1 canonical web
    implementation is in the local `9b575e2` working tree. Production `/`
    redirects to `/auth/login`, login/register still use the old auth layout,
    and private routes correctly redirect signed-out users to login.
  - Discrepancy register:
    `docs/ux/v1-production-canonical-discrepancy-audit-2026-05-15.md`.
  - Result: production parity is blocked by deploy drift; the next task is
    V1PROD-002 release and rerun of authenticated production screenshot
    comparison.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-production-canonical-parity-audit-task-contract.md`.

- V1WEB-INDEX-001 Web View UX Maturity Index.
  - Evidence: `docs/ux/v1-web-view-index-2026-05-15.md` now classifies active
    web routes as `V1 canonical`, `V1 foundation`, `V0 rebuild`,
    `V0 compatibility`, or `V2 deferred`. It records canonical sources,
    desktop/mobile target images, rebuild direction, owner journeys, and
    recommended build order. The React route registry now carries matching
    lightweight `uxStage`, canonical source, and rebuild-note metadata.
  - Validation: `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-web-view-index-task-contract.md`.

- V1AREA-002 Area Detail Canonical View.
  - Evidence: `/areas?area=:areaKey&view=:viewId` now opens a canonical
    selected-department view from the Company Atlas model while `/areas`
    remains the all-areas workbench. The view reuses the atlas shell and shows
    department identity, capability navigation, observe/decide/execute/delegate
    board, selected capability focus, tables/records/knowledge/provider
    evidence, and ownership/AI decision rail. Current canonical targets are
    `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-area-detail-desktop-canonical.png` and
    `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-area-detail-mobile-canonical.png`.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`, `npm run validate`, and `git diff
    --check` passed. Playwright fallback against `http://127.0.0.1:3138`
    verified `/areas?area=01-strategia&view=overview` on desktop `1366x900`
    and `/areas?area=01-strategia&view=ai` on mobile `390x844` with no
    horizontal overflow, console errors, or page errors.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-area-detail-canonical-task-contract.md`.

- V1AREA-003 Area Detail Capability Tabs.
  - Evidence: `/areas?area=:areaKey&view=:viewId` now renders distinct
    area-scoped capability boards for `overview`, `goals`, `workflows`,
    `tasks`, `knowledge`, `resources`, `decisions`, `ai`, and `add-view`.
    Each board is derived from existing connection data, readable area tables,
    table record snapshots, Drive scope, provider mappings, and MCP manifest
    context; no new backend route or fake data contract was introduced.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`, `npm run validate`, and `git diff
    --check` passed. Playwright fallback against `http://127.0.0.1:3144`
    clicked every desktop capability tab and verified mobile AI tab rendering
    at `390x844` with no horizontal overflow, console errors, or page errors.
    Screenshots:
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-area-detail-tabs-desktop.png` and
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-area-detail-tabs-mobile.png`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-area-detail-capability-tabs-task-contract.md`.

- V1AREA-004 Area Detail UX Polish.
  - Evidence: the selected-department view now has a calmer connected
    operating flow, lighter capability boards, improved mobile density, and
    explicit active-tab accessibility state while keeping the same backend data
    contracts.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`, `npm run validate`, and `git diff
    --check` passed. Playwright fallback against `http://127.0.0.1:3146`
    clicked every desktop capability tab and verified mobile AI tab rendering
    at `390x844` with no horizontal overflow, console errors, or page errors.
    Screenshots:
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-area-detail-polish-desktop.png` and
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-area-detail-polish-mobile.png`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-area-detail-ux-polish-task-contract.md`.

- V1WEB-002 Five Canonical Web Surfaces.
  - Evidence: `/` is now the public CompanyCore home route, `/auth/login` and
    `/auth/register` share the public layout, and `/dashboard` remains the
    private post-login Company Atlas. The selected-area route remains private
    on `/areas?area=:areaKey&view=:viewId`.
  - Canonical images: refreshed desktop/mobile targets for public home, login,
    registration, dashboard, and selected-area detail under `docs/ux/assets/`.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`, `npm run validate`, and `git diff
    --check` passed. Playwright fallback against `http://127.0.0.1:3148`
    rendered all five canonical views in desktop and mobile, plus dashboard
    tablet proof at `834x1112`, with no horizontal overflow, blank page,
    console errors, or page errors. Public home/login/register screenshots
    were refreshed again after the mobile public-nav refinement.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-web-five-canonical-surfaces-task-contract.md`.

- V1SETTINGS-001 Unified V1 Settings Canonical Design.
  - Evidence: the settings IA now uses sections for Integrations, Agent keys,
    and MCP. Integrations are contextual by provider and expose
    backend-supported credentials, active state, scope IDs, `syncMode`, and
    `importMode`; provider rows expose an active/disabled switch for pausing
    future sync/actions while preserving imported CompanyCore data. The
    selected provider exposes `Setup`, `Mapping`, and `Sync` tabs. Badges,
    counters, review queues, and large tool catalogs belong in dedicated work
    views.
  - Canonical images:
    `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-settings-desktop-canonical.png` and
    `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-settings-mobile-canonical.png`.
  - Spec:
    `docs/ux/v1-settings-canonical-spec-2026-05-15.md`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-settings-canonical-design-task-contract.md`.

- REACT-WEB-LAYOUT-001 Authenticated Layout Foundation.
  - Evidence: `web/src/app-route-registry.ts` now owns React route groups,
    canonical hrefs, aliases, prefix matching, shell navigation metadata, and
    post-auth redirect normalization. Owner login/register default to
    `/dashboard` while preserving safe pending private routes. Shared React
    shell navigation is registry-derived, and `ReactApp` uses a component map
    instead of repeated manual route branching.
  - Validation: `npm run build:web`, `npm run validate`, and `git diff
    --check` passed. Playwright fallback against local backend
    `http://127.0.0.1:3137` verified login -> `/dashboard`; `/dashboard`,
    `/`, `/react-dashboard`, `/areas`, `/react-areas`, `/settings/api`, and
    `/react-agent-tools` rendered with no route-level error panel and no
    horizontal overflow; mobile `/dashboard` at `390x844` had no horizontal
    overflow. Validation server and headless browser processes were cleaned up.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/react-web-layout-foundation-task-contract.md`.

- JARVIS-GDRIVE-001 Jarvis CompanyCore Google Drive E2E.
  - Evidence: production commit `b716f02` is deployed and public health reports
    image `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:b716f02`. Owner Google Drive OAuth
    decrypts successfully with refresh/access tokens present. Protected
    `npm run google-drive:smoke` passed with `googleDriveActive=true` and 748
    imported files. Owner folder discovery returned 174 folders, 13 selected
    roots, 173 included folders, and target folder `12. Zarządzanie`
    externalId `1U1GMpy0erVETPDA9ciRb7l1gVbSJfaff` selected/imported.
  - Jarvis-key smoke: using Jarvis' CompanyCore key only, CompanyCore created
    Google Doc `Protokół Wielkiej Narady Spinaczy` and Google Sheet
    `Budżet Na Kawę I Inne Poważne Excely` in folder `12. Zarządzanie`.
    CompanyCore returned file IDs/external IDs/links and read back both file
    contents through `/v1/google-drive/files/:id/content`.
  - Validation: `npm run validate` and `git diff --check` passed. Local
    `npm test` reached the build gate but stopped before API tests because
    this host has no `DATABASE_URL`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/jarvis-companycore-google-drive-e2e-task-contract.md`.

- GD-IMPORT-UX-001 Google Drive folder import organization.
  - Evidence: `/v1/integration-settings/google_drive/folders/discover` now
    returns organized folder metadata including path, depth, parent,
    selected/included/imported state, child/descendant counts, and direct
    imported item counts. `/settings/drive` now shows searchable root-folder
    selection, selected-scope filtering, imported/included badges, and scoped
    save/import actions.
  - Validation: production owner-token discovery smoke returned the target
    `12. Zarządzanie` folder with `selected=true`, `imported=true`, and
    `directImportedItemCount=3`.

- REACT-WEB-001 React web layer consolidation.
  - Evidence: all user-facing web routes are now served through the React/Vite
    bundle instead of `public/index.html`. Removed active vanilla web files:
    `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `public/index.html`,
    `public/relationship-workbench.js`, and
    `public/google-drive-workbench.js`.
  - Validation: `npm run validate` passed. Playwright signed-out proof covered
    auth pages and private-route login redirects. Playwright signed-in
    mocked-backend proof covered `/dashboard`, `/areas`, `/tasks-adapter`,
    `/settings/integrations`, `/react-agent-tools`, `/relationships`, `/data`,
    `/pipeline`, `/settings/api`, `/settings/drive`, `/settings/account`, and
    `/settings` with no old vanilla scripts, no old public shell, no console
    errors, no route error panels, and no horizontal overflow.
  - Residual risk: full ClickUp setup and full Google Drive OAuth/folder
    selection need dedicated React rebuild slices; current React routes expose
    real backend status and safe actions without copying the legacy vanilla
    forms.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/react-web-consolidation-task-contract.md`.

- V1AUTH-001 Owner auth redirect flow.
  - Evidence: private React routes with missing owner sessions now redirect to
    `/auth/login` instead of rendering a dead-end signed-out panel. Stale or
    invalid owner tokens are cleared and invalid dashboard bootstrap responses
    no longer show the generic dashboard load error. Login/register preserves
    the pending private route and opens React-owned routes through a full-page
    React shell redirect after authentication.
  - Deployment: pushed and manually rolled over production to commit
    `c62d662`, image `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:c62d662`, running
    container `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-c62d662`.
  - Validation: `npm run validate`, `git diff --check`, local Playwright
    stale-token and post-login pending-route proofs, plus production
    Playwright missing-session and stale-token checks passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1auth-001-owner-auth-redirect-task-contract.md`.

- V1AREA-001 premium production manual rollover to `1acb709`.
  - Evidence: after pushing the premium Company Atlas polish, public health
    still reported `79d8d0e`, so the approved archive-based manual VPS rollover
    built `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:1acb709`, started
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-1acb709`, verified public
    web/API `/health` with `build.commit="1acb709"`, and verified public
    `/dashboard` serves `index-wbA5Pvhk.js` plus `index-B1Wcb5DB.css`.

- V1AREA-001 production manual rollover to `df99969`.
  - Evidence: Coolify redeploy did not update the running image; public
    `/health` still reported `fb6aca9`. The approved archive-based manual VPS
    rollover built `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:df99969`, started
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-df99969`, verified container
    health, then stopped and retained the previous
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-fb6aca9-previous-df99969`
    rollback container. Public web/API `/health` now report
    `build.commit="df99969"`, and public `/dashboard` serves
    `index-0as746Hb.js` plus `index-Dafh8u4t.css`.

- V1AREA-001 Area-First Dashboard Pixel-Perfect Implementation.
  - Evidence: `/dashboard` now serves the React V1 area-first Company Atlas
    view. The implementation adds a dashboard-local area-first shell with
    canonical 00-12 LuckySparrow areas, expanded `01 Strategia`, area
    capability tabs, quiet command/search/status header, CSS/SVG atlas board,
    selected-area state, right `Today` decision rail, progressive path,
    mobile app bar, mobile company summary, horizontal area selector, and
    five-item mobile bottom nav. The view derives area labels/status/table
    counts, integration readiness, capabilities, workspace, and MCP scope from
    `/v1/connection` instead of static UI records.
    The latest premium parity pass added the final sidebar owner footer,
    subtle atlas/card material accents, visible desktop owner context in the
    first viewport, and a shorter mobile bottom nav with refreshed desktop and
    mobile evidence screenshots.
  - Changed files: `src/app.ts`, `web/src/main.tsx`, `web/src/styles.css`,
    generated `public/react/*`, and screenshot evidence in
    `docs/ux/evidence/`.
  - Validation: `npm run check:public-js`, `npm run build:server`,
    `npm run build:web`, `npm run validate`, and `git diff --check` passed.
    Playwright fallback verified the built `/dashboard` route with a
    controlled owner session and mocked `/v1/connection` at desktop
    `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844`: no horizontal
    overflow, no console/page errors, 13 area rows, 12 orbit nodes plus
    center, selected `01 Strategia`, hidden desktop mobile controls, mobile
    summary present, desktop sidebar hidden on tablet/mobile, and five mobile
    nav items. A follow-up fidelity pass flattened the desktop topbar to the
    canonical 71px bar, converted the atlas to circular icon nodes, moved the
    content row to the first viewport, and reduced the mobile orbit density.
    A later executive-panel pass aligned the selected-area panel with the
    canonical CEO overview: health banner, four area-signal tiles, Jarvis
    read-only readiness, primary strategy-review CTA, open-area link, MECE
    accountability note, and a `Today` rail with priority/decision/AI/proof
    groups. The latest parity continuation pass tightened the mobile appbar,
    `Dzialy` strip, mobile atlas heading/breadcrumb, four-metric summary,
    desktop sidebar density, and desktop progressive path icon/detail anatomy
    against the active canonical references.

    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-area-dashboard-mobile-390x844.png`.
  - Follow-up validation: `npm run test:api` passed against workspace-local
    PostgreSQL on `127.0.0.1:55476`; real backend Playwright proof verified
    selected-area desktop/mobile routes with screenshots
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-area-real-backend-selected-area-desktop.png` and
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-area-real-backend-selected-area-mobile.png`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-area-first-pixel-perfect-task-contract.md`.

- V2GD-010 Google Sheet Parent Folder Creation.
  - Evidence: deployed commit `669c1c8` to production through manual VPS
    rollover. Public `/health` and `/v1/health` report `build.commit` as
    `669c1c8`. CompanyCore protected Google Drive smoke passes for connection,
    capabilities, active Drive config, and 748 imported files. The route now
    accepts `parentId`; Sheets creation uses Drive `files.create` with MIME
    type `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet`, then writes values through
    Sheets API.
  - Remaining blocker: real Docs/Sheets content read/write is blocked by
    invalid stored Google Drive OAuth secret, tracked as JARVIS-GDRIVE-001.

- V1UX-CANON-001 Simple V1 Dashboard Canonical Design.
  - Evidence: published the V1 area-first Company Atlas direction, current UI
    audit, sitemap, component boundaries, Tailwind/DaisyUI style rules,
    pixel-perfect implementation plan, and generated canonical concept images.
    The current V1 implementation targets are
    `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-area-first-dashboard-desktop-canonical.png`
    and
    `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-area-first-dashboard-mobile-canonical.png`.
    `git diff --check` and manual image review passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-simple-dashboard-canonical-design-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-OPS-002 Build Metadata Health Restoration.
  - Evidence: restored source-level production build metadata wiring by
    deriving `build.commit` from `COMPANYCORE_BUILD_COMMIT`, `SOURCE_COMMIT`,
    or common Git commit env vars, and deriving `build.image` from
    `COMPANYCORE_BUILD_IMAGE`, Coolify/container variables, or `HOSTNAME`.
    `docker-compose.coolify.yml` now passes `SOURCE_COMMIT` and
    `COOLIFY_CONTAINER_NAME` into backend build/runtime metadata fields.
    `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and `npm run test:api` passed against
    portable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55475`, including a production health
    regression test that verified safe Coolify metadata appears in `/health`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/acf-ops-002-build-metadata-health-task-contract.md`.

- UX100-W05 Company OS And MCP Tools Alignment.
  - Evidence: added a shared React agent-authority bridge to
    `/react-company-os` and `/react-agent-tools`. The Company OS cockpit now
    summarizes pending approvals, blocked runtime, high risks, and MCP handoff;
    the MCP tools surface now summarizes visible tools, supervised tools,
    Company OS risk, and destructive authority using the same approval-first
    vocabulary. `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and `npm run test:api`
    passed against portable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55475`. Playwright
    fallback verified both routes on `http://127.0.0.1:3124` at desktop
    `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844` with bridge,
    approval, and MCP markers present, no horizontal overflow, no console
    issues, no failed requests, and zero unnamed visible controls.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/ux100-w05-company-os-mcp-alignment-task-contract.md`.

- UX100-W04 Tasks/Pipeline Operating Pressure Summaries.
  - Evidence: added task and pipeline operating-pressure summaries derived
    from existing task status, due dates, priorities, sources, selected ClickUp
    lists, pipeline stages, clients, deals, and interactions. `/tasks-adapter`
    now shows overdue, due-soon, open, high-priority, source, and next-action
    pressure. `/pipeline` now shows stage, usage, deal, touchpoint, and
    relationship-follow-up pressure. `npm run check:public-js`, `npm run
    validate`, `git diff --check`, and `npm run test:api` passed against
    portable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55475`. Playwright fallback verified
    `/tasks-adapter` and `/pipeline` on `http://127.0.0.1:3123` at desktop
    `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844` with pressure cards
    and next-action blocks present, no horizontal overflow, no console issues,
    no failed requests, and zero unnamed visible controls. Portable database,
    temporary QA script, and headless browser processes were cleaned up.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/ux100-w04-tasks-pipeline-pressure-task-contract.md`.

- UX100-W03 Relationship/Data Provenance And AI Safety Labels.
  - Evidence: added relationship and data provenance/readiness labels derived
    from existing confidence, source, API route, typed-editor, and operating
    area state. `/relationships` now distinguishes CompanyCore graph,
    provider hierarchy, route-inferred, owner-review, and unsupported families
    with AI-safe/review/blocked labels. `/data` and `/data/:slug` now show
    module, table, record-row, and inspector provenance plus AI readiness.
    `npm run check:public-js`, `npm run validate`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm run test:api` passed against portable PostgreSQL on
    `localhost:55475`. Playwright fallback verified `/relationships`,
    `/data`, `/data/tasks`, and `/data/clients` on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3122` at desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and
    mobile `390x844` with provenance/AI labels present, no horizontal
    overflow, no console issues, no failed requests, and zero unnamed visible
    controls. Portable database and browser validation processes were cleaned
    up.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/ux100-w03-relationship-data-provenance-task-contract.md`.

- UX100-W02 Shell Decision Brief And Mobile Quick Actions.
  - Evidence: extended the existing authenticated route command strip with
    state-derived route decision titles, what-matters text, blocked/review
    signal, and tone; added a shared five-action mobile/tablet quick rail for
    Map, Brief, Data, Tasks, and Settings without creating a second shell.
    `npm run check:public-js`, `npm run validate`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm run test:api` passed against portable PostgreSQL on
    `localhost:55475`. Playwright fallback verified `/dashboard`, `/areas`,
    `/relationships`, `/data/tasks`, `/settings/api`, and `/settings/drive`
    on `http://127.0.0.1:3121` at desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`,
    and mobile `390x844` with route command titles/signals/tones, hidden
    desktop quick rail, visible five-action tablet/mobile quick rail, no
    horizontal overflow, no console issues, no failed requests, and zero
    unnamed visible controls. Validation server, portable database, and
    headless browser processes were cleaned up.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/ux100-w02-shell-decision-brief-task-contract.md`.

- UX100-W01 Dashboard Command Brief And Mobile First Viewport.
  - Evidence: added a dashboard owner decision board above the Company map,
    deriving priority, blocker count, next action, AI readiness, company
    context, and top blockers from existing workspace state. `npm run
    check:public-js`, `npm run validate`, `git diff --check`, and `npm run
    test:api` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55474`.
    Playwright fallback verified `/dashboard` on `http://127.0.0.1:3120` at
    desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844` with four
    decision metrics, at least one decision item, 13 map cards, no horizontal
    overflow, no console issues, no failed requests, and zero unnamed visible
    controls. Validation server, database, and headless browser processes were
    cleaned up.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/ux100-w01-dashboard-command-brief-task-contract.md`.

- UX100-001 Web App UX100 Audit Atlas And Execution Plan.
  - Evidence: published
    `docs/ux/web-app-ux100-audit-and-execution-plan-2026-05-15.md` with 100
    cross-app UX audit findings and 100 execution steps mapped to owner,
    company-operation, and AI/MCP safety outcomes. Selected the first
    implementation waves UX100-W01 through UX100-W05 and activated UX100-W01
    as the next ready task. `git diff --check` and row-count sanity checks
    passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/ux100-001-web-app-audit-atlas-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-OPS-001 Auto-Deploy Proof Or Manual Path Acceptance Refresh.
  - Evidence: latest pushed commit was `ece93b1`; public web and API
    `/health` both returned `200`, but both reported `build.commit="unknown"`
    and `build.image="unknown"`. Updated deployment docs and KI-002 so
    GitHub-to-Coolify auto-deploy remains unverified, while manual
    VPS/Coolify backend rollover remains the accepted release path until
    commit/image metadata or equivalent Coolify evidence is available. `git
    diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/acf-ops-001-deploy-path-acceptance-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-QA-001 Validation Gate Entrypoints.
  - Evidence: added `npm run check:public-js`, `npm run test:api`, kept
    `npm test` as a compatibility wrapper, and made `npm run validate` run the
    public JS static check before build. Updated project-state validation
    commands and testing docs. `npm run check:public-js`, `npm run validate`,
    `git diff --check`, and `npm run test:api` passed against disposable
    PostgreSQL on `localhost:55473`; validation container was removed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/acf-qa-001-validation-gates-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-MAINT-002 Google Drive Workbench Context Extraction.
  - Evidence: added `public/google-drive-workbench.js` as the route-local
    module for Drive command summary/context rendering, loaded it before
    `public/app.js`, and reduced `renderGoogleDriveContext()` to a module
    delegation. `node --check public/app.js`, `node --check
    public/google-drive-workbench.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`,
    and `npm test` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55472`.
    Playwright fallback verified `/settings/drive` on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3119` at desktop `1366x900` and mobile `390x844` with
    the module loaded, four command cards, no horizontal overflow, no console
    issues, and no failed requests.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/acf-maint-002-google-drive-workbench-extraction-task-contract.md`.

- V2VIS-005 Settings Drive Route Body UX Polish.
  - Evidence: published
    `docs/ux/settings-drive-route-body-usability-audit-2026-05-15.md` with
    100 route-body findings; added `/settings/drive` Drive import command
    summary, OAuth/selection/import/area-review command cards, stable anchors
    for setup, folder selection, and imported files, plus responsive command
    grid CSS. `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff
    --check`, and `npm test` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on
    `localhost:55471`. Playwright fallback verified `/settings/drive` on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3118` at desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and
    mobile `390x844` with no horizontal overflow, no console issues, no failed
    requests, four command cards, working folder-picker anchor, and zero
    unnamed visible controls.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v2vis-005-settings-drive-route-body-polish-task-contract.md`.

    summary, active/scoped/broad key signals, MCP exposure and supervision
    command cards, route-body anchors, and responsive command grid. `node
    --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm test` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55470`.
    Playwright fallback verified `/settings/api` on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3117` at desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and
    mobile `390x844` with no horizontal overflow, no console issues, no failed
    requests, four command cards, and zero unnamed visible controls. Real
    create-key proof showed visible raw `cc_v1_` key and one active key row.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v2vis-004-settings-api-route-body-polish-task-contract.md`.

- ORG-ARCH-001 Organizational Architecture Bridge Memory Update.
  - Evidence: added
    `docs/architecture/organizational-architecture-bridge.md`, linked it from
    architecture source-of-truth docs, mapped the user's target concepts to the
    current database model in `docs/DATABASE.md`, and recorded DEC-015,
    CCORE-DM-007, and REQ-ORG-ARCH-001. `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/org-arch-001-organizational-architecture-bridge-task-contract.md`.

- V2VIS-002 Route Frame Convergence And Usability Repair.
  - Evidence: published `docs/ux/route-frame-usability-audit-2026-05-15.md`
    with 100 route-frame findings; added the vanilla route command strip;
    converted the shared React shell from header-only navigation into a
    company command shell with desktop command rail, grouped navigation,
    workspace status, compact topbar, and mobile shortcut rail. `node --check
    public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and `npm test`
    passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55468`. Playwright
    fallback verified `/dashboard`, `/data/tasks`, `/settings/drive`,
    `/settings/api`, `/areas`, `/react-agent-tools`, and `/react-company-os`
    at desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844` with no
    horizontal overflow, no console issues, no failed requests, and zero
    unnamed visible controls.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v2vis-002-route-frame-convergence-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-UX-003 Authenticated Shell Usability Repair.
  - Evidence: sidebar IA now uses company-management lanes (`Command`,
    `Company areas`, `Workbenches`, `Integrations & agents`, `Workspace`);
    the topbar is a compact command bar with command search and desktop
    status; dashboard duplicate page title is removed; React route header
    language now matches the canonical CompanyCore shell. `node --check
    public/app.js`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` passed against disposable
    PostgreSQL on `localhost:55467`. Playwright fallback verified desktop
    `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844` with no horizontal
    overflow, no console issues, no failed requests, mobile drawer open, and
    final mobile/tablet topbar height `65px`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/acf-ux-003-shell-usability-repair-task-contract.md`.

- PROD-HOTFIX-001 Coolify Restart Loop API Key Hash Fallback.
  - Evidence: public health returned `503` after deploy and local production
    config import reproduced the likely restart-loop condition when
    `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` was omitted. `src/config/env.ts` now falls back to
    required non-placeholder `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` for API key hashing when the
    separate hash secret is not configured. `git diff --check`,
    `npm run build`, and `npm test` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on
    `localhost:55466`, including a new production fallback regression test.
    Coolify runtime inspection then found empty values for `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`,
    `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET`, and `INTEGRATION_SECRET_KEY`; all three were
    populated with non-placeholder production values. Redeploy
    `l1i1ylihrss3d7xoxk4psu2n` finished, backend logs showed
    `companycore listening on port 3000`, and public web/API `/health`
    returned `200`.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/prod-hotfix-001-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-PROD-001 Operating Model Data Completion Decision.
  - Result: accepted deferral for fake seed data. Empty projects, storage
    locations, knowledge roots, and automation definitions are valid
    foundation-ready states when future UI labels them honestly and uses real
    owner creation/import flows.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/acf-prod-001-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-002/003/004 Workspace And Sidebar Foundation.
  - Evidence: `npm test` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on

    `mcp_tool_requires_supervision` behavior for the stage-complete MCP tool.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-012-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-013 V2 UX Readiness Review.
  - Evidence: `docs/ux/v2-ux-readiness-review-2026-05-14.md` reviewed
    WEBFOUND-002 through WEBFOUND-012 and recorded GO for WEBFOUND-014 visual
    planning while keeping direct Company City/gamification implementation
    gated on a canonical shell/map/brief/status plan.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-013-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-014 V2 Visual Implementation Plan.
  - Evidence: `docs/ux/v2-visual-implementation-plan-2026-05-14.md` defines
    the canonical V2 shell, Company City dashboard composition, command brief,
    status strip, responsive behavior, state model, visual asset strategy,
    route migration order, validation plan, and first future code candidate
    `V2VIS-001 Shared CompanyShell And Dashboard Frame`.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-014-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-MAINT-001 Large File Modularization.
  - Evidence: extracted the vanilla relationship workbench from `public/app.js`
    into `public/relationship-workbench.js`; `public/app.js` dropped from
    6527 to 6224 lines. `node --check public/app.js`, `node --check
    public/relationship-workbench.js`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` passed
    against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55464`; Playwright fallback
    verified `/relationships` on `http://127.0.0.1:3113` with the extracted
    module loaded, graph markers rendered, no overflow, no console issues, and
    no failed requests.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/acf-maint-001-task-contract.md`.

- V2VIS-001 Shared CompanyShell And Dashboard Frame.
  - Evidence: added a dashboard Company map frame using real workspace,
    operating-area, relationship, integration, task, and MCP state; fixed
    shared `data-link` query preservation so map cards deep-link to selected
    areas. `node --check public/app.js`, `node --check
    public/relationship-workbench.js`, `git diff --check`, and `npm test`
    passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55465`. Browser plugin
    invocation was blocked by no active Codex browser pane, so Playwright
    fallback verified `http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard` at desktop
    `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844`: 13 area cards, 4
    status pills, no overflow, no clipped cards, no console issues, no failed
    requests, desktop map-card click to `/areas?area=main-general`, and
    `/relationships` still loaded after ACF-MAINT-001.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/v2vis-001-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-DOC-001 Coverage Ledger Reconciliation.
  - Evidence: stale Google Drive first-import blocker language was reconciled
    in architecture, function-coverage audit, project-control, system-health,
    active queue, and state files. Targeted source review preserves future
    Drive content/write/freshness proof gaps without reopening first import.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/acf-doc-001-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-SEC-001 Production Secret And CORS Hardening.
  - Evidence: `npm run build` passed; `npm test` passed against disposable

  - Evidence: production now runs commit
    `a7557120b8ea4630a0b32097e66ba0d4bb012b1b`; public `/health` and
    `/v1/health` report that commit; signed-in Playwright route checks for
    `/dashboard`, `/data`, `/relationships`, `/settings/drive`,
    `/settings/api`, and `/areas` reported no failed requests and no console
    warnings or errors.

- AGRUN-007 Google Drive Owner Consent And First Import.
  - Evidence: production runs commit
    `c5878d95a47f17745f65689c08e9e317a6465777`; OAuth is active; folder
    discovery found 172 folders; 13 numbered department roots (`00`-`12`) were
    selected and imported; `/v1/google-drive/files` readback returned 748
    imported Drive items, including 171 folders; all imported items have an
