# TASK_BOARD

## Ready

- Continuous ClickUp update strategy
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Backend Builder
  - Priority: P1
  - Scope: choose either scheduled native pull sync, ClickUp webhook ingestion
    with `X-Signature` verification and webhook state storage, or external
    orchestration once the first production ClickUp pull is verified.

## Blocked

- CCV1-020 GitHub webhook auto-deploy completion
  - Stage: release
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P2
  - Blocked by: GitHub repository settings require an authenticated GitHub
    session or token with webhook administration permissions. Coolify
    `Auto Deploy` is enabled, but no deployment was created automatically after
    push.

## Backlog

No active backlog item beyond the continuous ClickUp update strategy and
Paperclip application-side adapter work tracked in
`docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`.
