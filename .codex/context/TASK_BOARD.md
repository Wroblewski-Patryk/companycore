# TASK_BOARD

## Ready

No ready implementation task is queued.

## In Progress

No active implementation task is in progress.

## Blocked

- JARVIS-GDRIVE-001 Jarvis CompanyCore Google Drive E2E.
  - Stage: verification
  - Owner: Backend Builder + Ops/Release
  - Priority: P0
  - Source:
    `docs/planning/jarvis-companycore-google-drive-e2e-task-contract.md`
  - Blocked by: production Google Drive OAuth ciphertext cannot be decrypted
    with the current `INTEGRATION_SECRET_KEY`; protected content refresh now
    returns controlled `401 integration_invalid_token`.
  - Next action: restore the matching integration secret or complete owner
    Google Drive OAuth re-consent from `/settings/drive`, then ask the Jarvis
    agent to run the two-file creation/readback smoke in folder
    `12. Zarządzanie`.
- AGRUN-010 Upstream Agent Source Merge Execution
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P2
  - Blocked by: external GitHub write access or an approved fork/PR route for
    Paperclip and OpenJarvis source handoff.
- CCV1-057B Paperclip upstream branch push
  - Stage: release
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P2
  - Blocked by: GitHub returned `403` for pushing
    `codex/companycore-adapter-v1` to `paperclipai/paperclip` as
    `Wroblewski-Patryk`. The adapter commit is validated locally and remains
    available as `4cfa476f` plus the managed CompanyCore patch.
- CCV1-058B OpenJarvis upstream branch push
  - Stage: release
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P2
  - Blocked by: GitHub returned `403` for pushing
    `codex/companycore-connector-v1` to `open-jarvis/OpenJarvis` as
    `Wroblewski-Patryk`. The connector change was replayed on clean
    `origin/main`, validated with 6 targeted tests, and remains available as
    the documented OpenJarvis source handoff.

## Backlog

- ACF-UX-002 Company City Dashboard / Gamified Strategic Map.
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Frontend Builder + Product Docs
  - Priority: P1
  - Source: `docs/ux/company-city-dashboard-v3-spec.md`
  - Goal: deferred V2 visual/game-like dashboard direction after the
    web/backend/MCP foundation readiness gate passes.
- Future v2 OAuth browser consent UI and token refresh hardening after core
  server-side API slices are complete.
- Future v2 dashboard surfaces that show ClickUp Lists, Drive folders/files,
  storage locations, knowledge roots, automations, and CompanyCore tables as
  one company operating area.
- Upstream OpenJarvis/Paperclip source merge execution and blocked GitHub
  auto-deploy webhook administration task.

## Done

- V1AREA-001 premium production manual rollover to `1acb709`.
  - Evidence: after pushing the premium Company Atlas polish, public health
    still reported `79d8d0e`, so the approved archive-based manual VPS rollover
    built `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:1acb709`, started
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-1acb709`, verified public
    web/API `/health` with `build.commit="1acb709"`, and verified public
    `/dashboard` serves `index-wbA5Pvhk.js` plus `index-B1Wcb5DB.css`.

- V1AREA-001 production manual rollover to `df99969`.
  - Evidence: Coolify redeploy did not update the running image; public
    `/health` still reported `fb6aca9`. The approved archive-based manual VPS
    rollover built `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:df99969`, started
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-df99969`, verified container
    health, then stopped and retained the previous
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-fb6aca9-previous-df99969`
    rollback container. Public web/API `/health` now report
    `build.commit="df99969"`, and public `/dashboard` serves
    `index-0as746Hb.js` plus `index-Dafh8u4t.css`.

- V1AREA-001 Area-First Dashboard Pixel-Perfect Implementation.
  - Evidence: `/dashboard` now serves the React V1 area-first Company Atlas
    view. The implementation adds a dashboard-local area-first shell with
    canonical 00-12 LuckySparrow areas, expanded `01 Strategia`, area
    capability tabs, quiet command/search/status header, CSS/SVG atlas board,
    selected-area state, right `Today` decision rail, progressive path,
    mobile app bar, mobile company summary, horizontal area selector, and
    five-item mobile bottom nav. The view derives area labels/status/table
    counts, integration readiness, capabilities, workspace, and MCP scope from
    `/v1/connection` instead of static UI records.
    The latest premium parity pass added the final sidebar owner footer,
    subtle atlas/card material accents, visible desktop owner context in the
    first viewport, and a shorter mobile bottom nav with refreshed desktop and
    mobile evidence screenshots.
  - Changed files: `src/app.ts`, `web/src/main.tsx`, `web/src/styles.css`,
    generated `public/react/*`, and screenshot evidence in
    `docs/ux/evidence/`.
  - Validation: `npm run check:public-js`, `npm run build:server`,
    `npm run build:web`, `npm run validate`, and `git diff --check` passed.
    Playwright fallback verified the built `/dashboard` route with a
    controlled owner session and mocked `/v1/connection` at desktop
    `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844`: no horizontal
    overflow, no console/page errors, 13 area rows, 12 orbit nodes plus
    center, selected `01 Strategia`, hidden desktop mobile controls, mobile
    summary present, desktop sidebar hidden on tablet/mobile, and five mobile
    nav items. A follow-up fidelity pass flattened the desktop topbar to the
    canonical 71px bar, converted the atlas to circular icon nodes, moved the
    content row to the first viewport, and reduced the mobile orbit density.
    A later executive-panel pass aligned the selected-area panel with the
    canonical CEO overview: health banner, four area-signal tiles, Jarvis
    read-only readiness, primary strategy-review CTA, open-area link, MECE
    accountability note, and a `Today` rail with priority/decision/AI/proof
    groups. The latest parity continuation pass tightened the mobile appbar,
    `Dzialy` strip, mobile atlas heading/breadcrumb, four-metric summary,
    desktop sidebar density, and desktop progressive path icon/detail anatomy
    against the active canonical references.
    Screenshots:
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-area-dashboard-desktop-1366x900.png`,
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-area-dashboard-tablet-834x1112.png`, and
    `docs/ux/evidence/v1-area-dashboard-mobile-390x844.png`.
  - Residual validation gap: `npm run test:api` remains blocked locally because
    `DATABASE_URL` is not set. A database-backed API regression run remains
    required before the next release/deploy claim.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-area-first-pixel-perfect-task-contract.md`.

- V2GD-010 Google Sheet Parent Folder Creation.
  - Evidence: deployed commit `669c1c8` to production through manual VPS
    rollover. Public `/health` and `/v1/health` report `build.commit` as
    `669c1c8`. CompanyCore protected Google Drive smoke passes for connection,
    capabilities, active Drive config, and 748 imported files. The route now
    accepts `parentId`; Sheets creation uses Drive `files.create` with MIME
    type `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet`, then writes values through
    Sheets API.
  - Remaining blocker: real Docs/Sheets content read/write is blocked by
    invalid stored Google Drive OAuth secret, tracked as JARVIS-GDRIVE-001.

- V1UX-CANON-001 Simple V1 Dashboard Canonical Design.
  - Evidence: published the V1 area-first Company Atlas direction, current UI
    audit, sitemap, component boundaries, Tailwind/DaisyUI style rules,
    pixel-perfect implementation plan, and generated canonical concept images.
    The current V1 implementation targets are
    `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-area-first-dashboard-desktop-canonical.png`
    and
    `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-area-first-dashboard-mobile-canonical.png`.
    `git diff --check` and manual image review passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v1-simple-dashboard-canonical-design-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-OPS-002 Build Metadata Health Restoration.
  - Evidence: restored source-level production build metadata wiring by
    deriving `build.commit` from `COMPANYCORE_BUILD_COMMIT`, `SOURCE_COMMIT`,
    or common Git commit env vars, and deriving `build.image` from
    `COMPANYCORE_BUILD_IMAGE`, Coolify/container variables, or `HOSTNAME`.
    `docker-compose.coolify.yml` now passes `SOURCE_COMMIT` and
    `COOLIFY_CONTAINER_NAME` into backend build/runtime metadata fields.
    `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and `npm run test:api` passed against
    portable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55475`, including a production health
    regression test that verified safe Coolify metadata appears in `/health`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/acf-ops-002-build-metadata-health-task-contract.md`.

- UX100-W05 Company OS And MCP Tools Alignment.
  - Evidence: added a shared React agent-authority bridge to
    `/react-company-os` and `/react-agent-tools`. The Company OS cockpit now
    summarizes pending approvals, blocked runtime, high risks, and MCP handoff;
    the MCP tools surface now summarizes visible tools, supervised tools,
    Company OS risk, and destructive authority using the same approval-first
    vocabulary. `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and `npm run test:api`
    passed against portable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55475`. Playwright
    fallback verified both routes on `http://127.0.0.1:3124` at desktop
    `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844` with bridge,
    approval, and MCP markers present, no horizontal overflow, no console
    issues, no failed requests, and zero unnamed visible controls.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/ux100-w05-company-os-mcp-alignment-task-contract.md`.

- UX100-W04 Tasks/Pipeline Operating Pressure Summaries.
  - Evidence: added task and pipeline operating-pressure summaries derived
    from existing task status, due dates, priorities, sources, selected ClickUp
    lists, pipeline stages, clients, deals, and interactions. `/tasks-adapter`
    now shows overdue, due-soon, open, high-priority, source, and next-action
    pressure. `/pipeline` now shows stage, usage, deal, touchpoint, and
    relationship-follow-up pressure. `npm run check:public-js`, `npm run
    validate`, `git diff --check`, and `npm run test:api` passed against
    portable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55475`. Playwright fallback verified
    `/tasks-adapter` and `/pipeline` on `http://127.0.0.1:3123` at desktop
    `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844` with pressure cards
    and next-action blocks present, no horizontal overflow, no console issues,
    no failed requests, and zero unnamed visible controls. Portable database,
    temporary QA script, and headless browser processes were cleaned up.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/ux100-w04-tasks-pipeline-pressure-task-contract.md`.

- UX100-W03 Relationship/Data Provenance And AI Safety Labels.
  - Evidence: added relationship and data provenance/readiness labels derived
    from existing confidence, source, API route, typed-editor, and operating
    area state. `/relationships` now distinguishes CompanyCore graph,
    provider hierarchy, route-inferred, owner-review, and unsupported families
    with AI-safe/review/blocked labels. `/data` and `/data/:slug` now show
    module, table, record-row, and inspector provenance plus AI readiness.
    `npm run check:public-js`, `npm run validate`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm run test:api` passed against portable PostgreSQL on
    `localhost:55475`. Playwright fallback verified `/relationships`,
    `/data`, `/data/tasks`, and `/data/clients` on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3122` at desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and
    mobile `390x844` with provenance/AI labels present, no horizontal
    overflow, no console issues, no failed requests, and zero unnamed visible
    controls. Portable database and browser validation processes were cleaned
    up.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/ux100-w03-relationship-data-provenance-task-contract.md`.

- UX100-W02 Shell Decision Brief And Mobile Quick Actions.
  - Evidence: extended the existing authenticated route command strip with
    state-derived route decision titles, what-matters text, blocked/review
    signal, and tone; added a shared five-action mobile/tablet quick rail for
    Map, Brief, Data, Tasks, and Settings without creating a second shell.
    `npm run check:public-js`, `npm run validate`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm run test:api` passed against portable PostgreSQL on
    `localhost:55475`. Playwright fallback verified `/dashboard`, `/areas`,
    `/relationships`, `/data/tasks`, `/settings/api`, and `/settings/drive`
    on `http://127.0.0.1:3121` at desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`,
    and mobile `390x844` with route command titles/signals/tones, hidden
    desktop quick rail, visible five-action tablet/mobile quick rail, no
    horizontal overflow, no console issues, no failed requests, and zero
    unnamed visible controls. Validation server, portable database, and
    headless browser processes were cleaned up.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/ux100-w02-shell-decision-brief-task-contract.md`.

- UX100-W01 Dashboard Command Brief And Mobile First Viewport.
  - Evidence: added a dashboard owner decision board above the Company map,
    deriving priority, blocker count, next action, AI readiness, company
    context, and top blockers from existing workspace state. `npm run
    check:public-js`, `npm run validate`, `git diff --check`, and `npm run
    test:api` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55474`.
    Playwright fallback verified `/dashboard` on `http://127.0.0.1:3120` at
    desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844` with four
    decision metrics, at least one decision item, 13 map cards, no horizontal
    overflow, no console issues, no failed requests, and zero unnamed visible
    controls. Validation server, database, and headless browser processes were
    cleaned up.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/ux100-w01-dashboard-command-brief-task-contract.md`.

- UX100-001 Web App UX100 Audit Atlas And Execution Plan.
  - Evidence: published
    `docs/ux/web-app-ux100-audit-and-execution-plan-2026-05-15.md` with 100
    cross-app UX audit findings and 100 execution steps mapped to owner,
    company-operation, and AI/MCP safety outcomes. Selected the first
    implementation waves UX100-W01 through UX100-W05 and activated UX100-W01
    as the next ready task. `git diff --check` and row-count sanity checks
    passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/ux100-001-web-app-audit-atlas-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-OPS-001 Auto-Deploy Proof Or Manual Path Acceptance Refresh.
  - Evidence: latest pushed commit was `ece93b1`; public web and API
    `/health` both returned `200`, but both reported `build.commit="unknown"`
    and `build.image="unknown"`. Updated deployment docs and KI-002 so
    GitHub-to-Coolify auto-deploy remains unverified, while manual
    VPS/Coolify backend rollover remains the accepted release path until
    commit/image metadata or equivalent Coolify evidence is available. `git
    diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/acf-ops-001-deploy-path-acceptance-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-QA-001 Validation Gate Entrypoints.
  - Evidence: added `npm run check:public-js`, `npm run test:api`, kept
    `npm test` as a compatibility wrapper, and made `npm run validate` run the
    public JS static check before build. Updated project-state validation
    commands and testing docs. `npm run check:public-js`, `npm run validate`,
    `git diff --check`, and `npm run test:api` passed against disposable
    PostgreSQL on `localhost:55473`; validation container was removed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/acf-qa-001-validation-gates-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-MAINT-002 Google Drive Workbench Context Extraction.
  - Evidence: added `public/google-drive-workbench.js` as the route-local
    module for Drive command summary/context rendering, loaded it before
    `public/app.js`, and reduced `renderGoogleDriveContext()` to a module
    delegation. `node --check public/app.js`, `node --check
    public/google-drive-workbench.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`,
    and `npm test` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55472`.
    Playwright fallback verified `/settings/drive` on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3119` at desktop `1366x900` and mobile `390x844` with
    the module loaded, four command cards, no horizontal overflow, no console
    issues, and no failed requests.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/acf-maint-002-google-drive-workbench-extraction-task-contract.md`.

- V2VIS-005 Settings Drive Route Body UX Polish.
  - Evidence: published
    `docs/ux/settings-drive-route-body-usability-audit-2026-05-15.md` with
    100 route-body findings; added `/settings/drive` Drive import command
    summary, OAuth/selection/import/area-review command cards, stable anchors
    for setup, folder selection, and imported files, plus responsive command
    grid CSS. `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff
    --check`, and `npm test` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on
    `localhost:55471`. Playwright fallback verified `/settings/drive` on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3118` at desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and
    mobile `390x844` with no horizontal overflow, no console issues, no failed
    requests, four command cards, working folder-picker anchor, and zero
    unnamed visible controls.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v2vis-005-settings-drive-route-body-polish-task-contract.md`.

- V2VIS-003 Areas Route Body UX Polish.
  - Evidence: published `docs/ux/areas-route-body-usability-audit-2026-05-15.md`
    with 100 route-body findings; added `/areas` area command summary,
    review/coverage command cards, earlier filters, anchors for review queues,
    selected context, lifecycle, coverage, and table sections, plus mobile
    density CSS. `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and `npm test` passed
    against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55469`. Playwright fallback
    verified `/areas` on `http://127.0.0.1:3116` at desktop `1366x900`,
    tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844` with no horizontal overflow, no
    console issues, no failed requests, four command cards, and zero unnamed
    visible controls.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v2vis-003-areas-route-body-polish-task-contract.md`.

- V2VIS-004 Settings API Route Body UX Polish.
  - Evidence: published
    `docs/ux/settings-api-route-body-usability-audit-2026-05-15.md` with 100
    route-body findings; added `/settings/api` agent-access safety command
    summary, active/scoped/broad key signals, MCP exposure and supervision
    command cards, route-body anchors, and responsive command grid. `node
    --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm test` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55470`.
    Playwright fallback verified `/settings/api` on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3117` at desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and
    mobile `390x844` with no horizontal overflow, no console issues, no failed
    requests, four command cards, and zero unnamed visible controls. Real
    create-key proof showed visible raw `cc_v1_` key and one active key row.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v2vis-004-settings-api-route-body-polish-task-contract.md`.

- ORG-ARCH-001 Organizational Architecture Bridge Memory Update.
  - Evidence: added
    `docs/architecture/organizational-architecture-bridge.md`, linked it from
    architecture source-of-truth docs, mapped the user's target concepts to the
    current database model in `docs/DATABASE.md`, and recorded DEC-015,
    CCORE-DM-007, and REQ-ORG-ARCH-001. `git diff --check` passed.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/org-arch-001-organizational-architecture-bridge-task-contract.md`.

- V2VIS-002 Route Frame Convergence And Usability Repair.
  - Evidence: published `docs/ux/route-frame-usability-audit-2026-05-15.md`
    with 100 route-frame findings; added the vanilla route command strip;
    converted the shared React shell from header-only navigation into a
    company command shell with desktop command rail, grouped navigation,
    workspace status, compact topbar, and mobile shortcut rail. `node --check
    public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and `npm test`
    passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55468`. Playwright
    fallback verified `/dashboard`, `/data/tasks`, `/settings/drive`,
    `/settings/api`, `/areas`, `/react-agent-tools`, and `/react-company-os`
    at desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844` with no
    horizontal overflow, no console issues, no failed requests, and zero
    unnamed visible controls.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/v2vis-002-route-frame-convergence-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-UX-003 Authenticated Shell Usability Repair.
  - Evidence: sidebar IA now uses company-management lanes (`Command`,
    `Company areas`, `Workbenches`, `Integrations & agents`, `Workspace`);
    the topbar is a compact command bar with command search and desktop
    status; dashboard duplicate page title is removed; React route header
    language now matches the canonical CompanyCore shell. `node --check
    public/app.js`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` passed against disposable
    PostgreSQL on `localhost:55467`. Playwright fallback verified desktop
    `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844` with no horizontal
    overflow, no console issues, no failed requests, mobile drawer open, and
    final mobile/tablet topbar height `65px`.
  - Task contract:
    `docs/planning/acf-ux-003-shell-usability-repair-task-contract.md`.

- PROD-HOTFIX-001 Coolify Restart Loop API Key Hash Fallback.
  - Evidence: public health returned `503` after deploy and local production
    config import reproduced the likely restart-loop condition when
    `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` was omitted. `src/config/env.ts` now falls back to
    required non-placeholder `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` for API key hashing when the
    separate hash secret is not configured. `git diff --check`,
    `npm run build`, and `npm test` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on
    `localhost:55466`, including a new production fallback regression test.
    Coolify runtime inspection then found empty values for `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`,
    `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET`, and `INTEGRATION_SECRET_KEY`; all three were
    populated with non-placeholder production values. Redeploy
    `l1i1ylihrss3d7xoxk4psu2n` finished, backend logs showed
    `companycore listening on port 3000`, and public web/API `/health`
    returned `200`.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/prod-hotfix-001-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-PROD-001 Operating Model Data Completion Decision.
  - Result: accepted deferral for fake seed data. Empty projects, storage
    locations, knowledge roots, and automation definitions are valid
    foundation-ready states when future UI labels them honestly and uses real
    owner creation/import flows.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/acf-prod-001-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-002/003/004 Workspace And Sidebar Foundation.
  - Evidence: `npm test` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on
    `localhost:55453`; Playwright owner-shell smoke passed against isolated
    `http://127.0.0.1:3106` with desktop `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and
    mobile `390x844`. Smoke verified register/bootstrap, workspace create,
    workspace switch back, 13 sidebar operating areas, no horizontal overflow,
    no relevant console errors, no failed requests, and mobile/tablet drawer
    close via backdrop.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-002-004-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-005 Sidebar Area Tree Hardening.
  - Evidence: `node --check public/app.js`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm test` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55455`;
    Playwright smoke passed against isolated `http://127.0.0.1:3107`, proving
    13 area summaries, 52 resource-family labels, active area state,
    workspace-create Escape close, mobile Escape close, backdrop close, no
    overflow, no console issues, and no failed requests.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-005-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-007 Relationship Graph Audit.
  - Evidence: source review classified implemented, inferred, unsupported,
    and missing relationship families across Prisma schema, operating model
    routes, and current owner web surfaces. `git diff --check` passed.
  - Audit: `docs/architecture/relationship-graph-audit-2026-05-14.md`.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-007-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-008A Relationship Graph Read API.
  - Evidence: `npm run build` passed; `npm test` passed against disposable
    PostgreSQL on `localhost:55457`, covering relationship graph shape,
    direct/provider-hierarchy/route-inferred confidence labels, review items,
    unsupported families, `relationships:read` profile scope, and MCP manifest
    exposure. Validation container `companycore-test-postgres-webfound008a`
    was removed.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-008a-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-008B Relationship Workbench Upgrade.
  - Evidence: `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, and `npm test`
    passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55458`; Playwright
    fallback rendered `/relationships` on `http://127.0.0.1:3108`, verifying
    graph markers, route-inferred filter state, desktop `1366x900`, mobile
    `390x844`, no overflow, no console issues, and no failed requests.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-008b-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-009 Integration Readiness Dashboard.
  - Evidence: `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, and `npm test`
    passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55459`; Playwright
    fallback rendered `/settings/integrations` on
    `http://127.0.0.1:3109`, verifying readiness markers for ClickUp, Google
    Drive, relationship graph, MCP agents, scoped API access, desktop
    `1366x900`, tablet `820x1000`, mobile `390x844`, no overflow, no console
    issues, and no failed requests.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-009-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-010 MCP Key Workspace Clarity.
  - Evidence: `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, and `npm test`
    passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55460`; Playwright
    fallback rendered `/settings/api` on `http://127.0.0.1:3110`, verifying
    workspace agent access context, key preview markers, preset risk update,
    missing MCP base-scope warning after scope edit, desktop `1366x900`,
    tablet `820x1000`, mobile `390x844`, no overflow, no console issues, and
    no failed requests.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-010-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-011 Agent Tool Surface In Canonical Shell.
  - Evidence: `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, and `npm test`
    passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55461`; Playwright
    fallback opened `/react-agent-tools` from the canonical `/dashboard`
    sidebar on `http://127.0.0.1:3111`, verified MCP tool markers,
    canonical React header destinations, removal of old React-only nav labels,
    return to `/settings/api`, desktop `1366x900`, tablet `820x1000`, mobile
    `390x844`, no overflow, no console issues, and no relevant failed
    requests.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-011-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-012 AI-Ready Smoke Pack.
  - Evidence: added `npm run ai-ready:smoke`; `node --check
    scripts/companycore-ai-ready-smoke.mjs` passed; `npm test` passed against
    disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55462`; `npm run ai-ready:smoke`
    passed against `http://127.0.0.1:3112`, proving disposable owner
    bootstrap, MCP reader/operator profile key creation, manifest visibility,
    HTTP and MCP relationship graph reads, and default fail-closed
    `mcp_tool_requires_supervision` behavior for the stage-complete MCP tool.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-012-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-013 V2 UX Readiness Review.
  - Evidence: `docs/ux/v2-ux-readiness-review-2026-05-14.md` reviewed
    WEBFOUND-002 through WEBFOUND-012 and recorded GO for WEBFOUND-014 visual
    planning while keeping direct Company City/gamification implementation
    gated on a canonical shell/map/brief/status plan.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-013-task-contract.md`.

- WEBFOUND-014 V2 Visual Implementation Plan.
  - Evidence: `docs/ux/v2-visual-implementation-plan-2026-05-14.md` defines
    the canonical V2 shell, Company City dashboard composition, command brief,
    status strip, responsive behavior, state model, visual asset strategy,
    route migration order, validation plan, and first future code candidate
    `V2VIS-001 Shared CompanyShell And Dashboard Frame`.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/webfound-014-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-MAINT-001 Large File Modularization.
  - Evidence: extracted the vanilla relationship workbench from `public/app.js`
    into `public/relationship-workbench.js`; `public/app.js` dropped from
    6527 to 6224 lines. `node --check public/app.js`, `node --check
    public/relationship-workbench.js`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` passed
    against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55464`; Playwright fallback
    verified `/relationships` on `http://127.0.0.1:3113` with the extracted
    module loaded, graph markers rendered, no overflow, no console issues, and
    no failed requests.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/acf-maint-001-task-contract.md`.

- V2VIS-001 Shared CompanyShell And Dashboard Frame.
  - Evidence: added a dashboard Company map frame using real workspace,
    operating-area, relationship, integration, task, and MCP state; fixed
    shared `data-link` query preservation so map cards deep-link to selected
    areas. `node --check public/app.js`, `node --check
    public/relationship-workbench.js`, `git diff --check`, and `npm test`
    passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55465`. Browser plugin
    invocation was blocked by no active Codex browser pane, so Playwright
    fallback verified `http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard` at desktop
    `1366x900`, tablet `834x1112`, and mobile `390x844`: 13 area cards, 4
    status pills, no overflow, no clipped cards, no console issues, no failed
    requests, desktop map-card click to `/areas?area=main-general`, and
    `/relationships` still loaded after ACF-MAINT-001.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/v2vis-001-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-DOC-001 Coverage Ledger Reconciliation.
  - Evidence: stale Google Drive first-import blocker language was reconciled
    in architecture, function-coverage audit, project-control, system-health,
    active queue, and state files. Targeted source review preserves future
    Drive content/write/freshness proof gaps without reopening first import.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/acf-doc-001-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-SEC-001 Production Secret And CORS Hardening.
  - Evidence: `npm run build` passed; `npm test` passed against disposable
    PostgreSQL on `localhost:55452`, including missing production secret
    rejection, development placeholder secret rejection, production CORS
    allow/deny behavior, and the existing protected API flow.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/acf-sec-001-task-contract.md`.

- ACF-UX-001 Mobile Overflow And Focus Accessibility Fix.
  - Evidence: `npm run build` passed; signed-in Playwright fallback checked
    `/settings/api` and `/react-company-os` at desktop `1440x960` and mobile
    `390x844` with `horizontalOverflow=false`, `unnamedFocusableCount=0`, no
    console warnings/errors, and no relevant failed requests; `npm test`
    passed against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55451`.
  - Task contract: `docs/planning/acf-ux-001-task-contract.md`.

- APP-AUDIT-001 Application Completion Audit Bundle.
  - Evidence: `npm run build` passed; `npm test` passed against disposable
    PostgreSQL on `localhost:55450`; production protected API sample passed;
    production signed-in Playwright route audit covered 12 routes at desktop
    and mobile with no failed requests or console warnings/errors. Findings
    and finish queue are recorded in
    `docs/operations/application-completion-audit-2026-05-14.md`.

- PROD-HOTFIX-001 Owner Console Snapshot Routing.
  - Evidence: production now runs commit
    `a7557120b8ea4630a0b32097e66ba0d4bb012b1b`; public `/health` and
    `/v1/health` report that commit; signed-in Playwright route checks for
    `/dashboard`, `/data`, `/relationships`, `/settings/drive`,
    `/settings/api`, and `/areas` reported no failed requests and no console
    warnings or errors.

- AGRUN-007 Google Drive Owner Consent And First Import.
  - Evidence: production runs commit
    `c5878d95a47f17745f65689c08e9e317a6465777`; OAuth is active; folder
    discovery found 172 folders; 13 numbered department roots (`00`-`12`) were
    selected and imported; `/v1/google-drive/files` readback returned 748
    imported Drive items, including 171 folders; all imported items have an
    operating-area assignment and descendant scope verification reported
    `mismatches=[]`.
