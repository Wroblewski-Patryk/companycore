# TASK_BOARD

## Ready

- CCV1-036A Webhook Schema And Security Foundation
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: DB/Migrations + Backend Builder
  - Priority: P0
  - Scope: add webhook registration, provider inbox, agent outbox schema,
    raw-body ClickUp webhook route foundation, and HMAC SHA-256 signature
    verification tests.

- CCV1-036B ClickUp Webhook Registration
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Backend Builder
  - Priority: P0
  - Scope: add ClickUp get/create/update/delete webhook client methods and an
    owner reconcile API that stores returned webhook secrets encrypted.

- CCV1-036C ClickUp Webhook Receiver And Inbox
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Backend Builder
  - Priority: P0
  - Scope: add `POST /v1/webhooks/clickup`, verify `X-Signature`, persist
    idempotent inbox rows, and acknowledge valid events quickly.

- CCV1-036D Task Event Processor
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Backend Builder
  - Priority: P0
  - Scope: process ClickUp task events, especially `taskStatusUpdated`, update
    CompanyCore tasks, and emit internal events.

- CCV1-036E Agent Event Bridge
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Backend Builder
  - Priority: P0
  - Scope: expose provider-neutral agent events so Paperclip, Jarvis, Aviary,
    and future bridges can react without ClickUp-specific logic.

- CCV1-036F Production Webhook Smoke
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P0
  - Scope: deploy webhook runtime, reconcile selected List webhooks, change a
    real ClickUp task status, and verify CompanyCore plus agent-event readback.

## Blocked

- CCV1-020 GitHub webhook auto-deploy completion
  - Stage: release
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P2
  - Blocked by: GitHub repository settings require an authenticated GitHub
    session or token with webhook administration permissions. Coolify
    `Auto Deploy` is enabled, but no deployment was created automatically after
    push.

No active backlog item beyond the continuous ClickUp update strategy and
Paperclip application-side adapter work tracked in
