# TASK_BOARD

## Ready

- Implement Paperclip application-side adapter code
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Backend Builder
  - Priority: P0
  - Scope: update Paperclip so it reads `COMPANYCORE_BASE_URL` and
    `COMPANYCORE_API_KEY`, consumes CompanyCore agent events, and writes
    relevant records back through CompanyCore instead of direct provider paths.

## Blocked

- CCV1-020 GitHub webhook auto-deploy completion
  - Stage: release
  - Owner: Ops/Release
  - Priority: P2
  - Blocked by: GitHub repository settings require an authenticated GitHub
    session or token with webhook administration permissions. Coolify
    `Auto Deploy` is enabled, but no deployment was created automatically after
    push.

## Backlog

- CCV1-052 Relationship Mapping Reassignment API And UI
  - Stage: planning
  - Owner: Backend Builder + Frontend Builder
  - Priority: P1
  - Scope: after the read-first areas explorer, add a safe mapping reassignment
    endpoint and one-at-a-time GUI correction flow for provider containers.
