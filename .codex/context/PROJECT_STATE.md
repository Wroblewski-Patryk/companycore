# PROJECT_STATE

Last updated: 2026-05-02

## Product Snapshot
- Name: LuckySparrow Company Core
- Goal: Central backend for company projects, goals, tasks, CRM, notes,
  decisions, agents, and system events.
- Commercial model: Internal operational infrastructure.
- Current phase: v1 foundation.

## Product Decisions (Confirmed)
- 2026-05-02: No GUI in v1.
- 2026-05-02: PostgreSQL is the source of truth.
- 2026-05-02: API is the only supported access layer.
- 2026-05-02: CompanyCore owns the first native integration adapter:
  ClickUp -> CompanyCore -> PostgreSQL -> event. n8n remains optional for
  orchestration only when a workflow is better outside the backend.
- 2026-05-02: v1 must include an ownership boundary: registration creates a
  workspace and an owner user, and integration settings/secrets belong to the
  workspace rather than global process state.

## Technical Baseline
- Backend: Node.js 22, Express, TypeScript.
- Frontend: None.
- Mobile: None.
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma.
- Infra: Docker Compose.
- Hosting target: Coolify-compatible Docker Compose.
- Deployment shape: backend + postgres.
- Runtime services: `backend`, `postgres`.
- Background jobs / workers: None in v1.
- Persistent storage: Docker volume `companycore_postgres`.
- Health / readiness checks: `GET /health`.
- Environment files: `.env.example`.
- Observability: minimal system events table.
- MCP / external tools: ClickUp API is called by a native CompanyCore
  integration adapter; n8n may call API endpoints for optional orchestration.
- Auth / ownership: v1 workspace owner model with user registration, login,
  automatic workspace bootstrap, bearer auth context, workspace-scoped API key
  context, and workspace-scoped integration settings.

## Validation Commands
- Lint: Not configured.
- Typecheck: `npm run build`
- Unit tests: Not configured in v1.
- Integration tests: `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at a disposable
  PostgreSQL database.
- E2E / smoke: `GET /health`, register owner/workspace, authenticate, create
  project, create task, configure workspace ClickUp settings, trigger native
  ClickUp sync, verify synced task and event.
- Other high-risk checks: `docker compose up -d --build`

## Deployment Contract
- Primary deploy path: Docker Compose.
- Coolify app/service layout: one backend service plus one Postgres service.
- Dockerfiles / compose paths: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`.
- Required secrets: `DATABASE_URL`, `SEED_API_KEY`, `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`,
  `INTEGRATION_SECRET_KEY`, optional `PORT`; local seed may use `SEED_OWNER_EMAIL`,
  `SEED_OWNER_PASSWORD`, and `SEED_WORKSPACE_NAME`; ClickUp tokens must be
  stored as workspace integration settings, not hardcoded process globals.
- Public URLs / ports: backend on `3000`; deployed domains to document and
  verify are `companycore.luckysparrow.ch` and
  `api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch`.
- Backup / restore expectation: Postgres volume backups required before
  production use.
- Rollback trigger and method: redeploy previous image/commit and preserve
  Postgres volume.

## Current Focus
- Main active objective: complete protected production smoke and prepare the
  next v1 database/API coverage slice.
- Top blockers: production owner/API key plus ClickUp settings are needed for
  protected smoke; GitHub repository webhook setup needs an authenticated
  GitHub session or token with webhook administration permissions.
- Success criteria for this phase: canonical docs, workspace/auth model,
  task board, planning queue, deployment domains, migration strategy, event
  coverage, API/error contracts, regression guardrails, tests, observability,
  and deployment smoke evidence are aligned.

## Autonomous Iteration State
- Current iteration: CCV1-021 adapter connection handshake.
- Current operation mode: BUILDER
- Last completed iteration: CCV1-021 adapter connection handshake.
- Last completed task: added `/v1/connection` as a safe service-adapter
  handshake for Paperclip, Jarvis, Jarvan, Aviary, n8n, and similar clients.
- Next required mode: BUILDER for adapter production smoke once credentials are
  available.

## Recent Progress
- 2026-05-02: Created Company Core backend foundation, Prisma schema, Docker
  runtime, API key auth, minimal endpoints, ClickUp sync, event logging, and
  docs.
- 2026-05-02: Audited repository against CompanyCore v1 expectations. Confirmed
  build passes and identified planning/doc drift, missing event types,
  migration risk, plaintext API key storage, missing deployment domains, and
  incomplete route modules.
- 2026-05-02: Converted audit findings into the CCV1 task queue and task
  contracts under `docs/planning/`.
- 2026-05-02: Revised integration direction by user decision: CompanyCore v1
  should implement native ClickUp integration directly instead of requiring
  n8n workflows as the primary path.
- 2026-05-02: Revised auth/ownership direction by user decision: v1 should
  create a workspace with an owner user during registration, and workspace
  settings should own integration configuration such as ClickUp credentials.
- 2026-05-02: Added regression-prevention plan covering API contracts,
  workspace guardrail tests, migration/bootstrap safety, integration adapter
  contracts, and observability minimums.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-001 by replacing canonical architecture and
  Coolify deployment placeholders with CompanyCore-specific architecture and
  operations truth.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-011 by documenting owner email/password auth,
  workspace creation at registration, owner-only membership for v1, and
  workspace-scoped service API keys.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-014 by documenting stable API response envelopes,
  error response shape, standard error codes, and safe error redaction rules.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-015 by expanding the workspace guardrail test
  matrix for protected route types, service keys, integration settings, secret
  redaction, and native sync behavior.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-003 by adding the v1 foundation Prisma migration,
  switching Docker startup to `prisma migrate deploy`, and documenting rollback
  expectations.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-012 by adding owner registration/login,
  automatic workspace creation, bearer token auth, password hashing,
  workspace-aware API key context, workspace/auth migration, and local seed
  bootstrap.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-013 by adding workspace-scoped integration
  settings, encrypted token storage, ClickUp configuration routes, integration
  settings service helpers, and source-of-truth docs.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-017 by documenting the native integration adapter
  contract, idempotency, safe provider errors, observability fields, and
  ClickUp smoke signals.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-010 by implementing the first native pull-only
  ClickUp task sync adapter, workspace-scoped task ownership, idempotent
  `(workspace_id, source, external_id)` upsert, and safe sync events.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-004 by adding missing `client_created`,
  `deal_created`, and `note_created` events to create routes.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-005 by recording production domains, smoke
  checks, required deployment secrets, and rollback notes for preserving the
  PostgreSQL volume.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-016 by documenting migration review/testing,
  local seed, production first-owner bootstrap, credential rotation, and
  rollback/recovery policy.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-007 by adding hashed workspace service API key
  storage, transition-compatible lookup, seed hash population, and rotation
  documentation.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-006 by adding Node integration tests covering
  health, auth, workspace API keys, task scoping, ClickUp settings redaction,
  native ClickUp sync, events, and fresh `prisma migrate deploy`; removed a BOM
  from the foundation migration after the fresh migration test exposed it.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-008 by resolving DEC-001 and DEC-003, adding
  `/v1/*` route aliases without `/api`, preserving root compatibility aliases,
  and implementing workspace-scoped decisions and agent-log endpoints.
- 2026-05-02: Started CCV1-009 production verification. Public
  `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/health` returned healthy status,
  but `GET /v1/health` returned `401 Unauthorized`, so production is not yet
  verified against the current v1 route build. Protected smoke remains blocked
  pending deployment and production credentials.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-018 by adding owner-only adapter API key
  management so Jarvan, Aviary, and similar agents can receive workspace
  service credentials without GUI work or direct database access.
- 2026-05-02: Added production seed transition fix so existing legacy plaintext
  `SEED_API_KEY` rows are updated with `key_hash` instead of creating a
  duplicate unique key during redeploy.
- 2026-05-02: Reproduced the production startup failure in local Docker. Fixed
  runtime seed imports so `prisma/seed.ts` does not depend on uncopied `src/`
  files, and fixed the runtime image to copy the generated Prisma Client from
  the build stage. Local `docker compose up --build -d` now applies migrations,
  runs seed, starts the API, and returns `ok` for `/health` and `/v1/health`.
- 2026-05-02: Recovered production Coolify deployment. Root cause was Prisma
  `P3005` because production already had the foundation schema but no
  `_prisma_migrations` baseline. Added a one-time baseline row for
  `202605021_v1_foundation`, forced redeploy `r4hgrbmh5obfvz9v61mlbgyc` to
  commit `3f64a72`, confirmed backend logs show no pending migrations, seed
  success, and `companycore listening on port 3000`, then verified public
  `/health`, `/v1/health`, and unauthenticated `/v1/projects` negative smoke.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-019 by adding workspace ownership to projects,
  goals, targets, task lists, clients, pipeline stages, deals, interactions,
  notes, agents, and events. Protected routes for projects, goals, targets,
  clients, deals, notes, events, decisions, agent logs, and tasks now filter by
  the active workspace and reject foreign relation IDs with `not_found`.
- 2026-05-02: Deployed CCV1-019 to production with manual Coolify redeploy
  `zibcl0a0rih1vmhig3vkf4ce` at commit `1d6f21a`. Backend logs confirmed
  migration `202605028_workspace_core_records`, seed success, and server start;
  public `/health`, `/v1/health`, and unauthenticated `/v1/projects` smoke
  passed. Coolify `Auto Deploy` is enabled, but no GitHub webhook deployment
  fired after push because GitHub repository settings were not authenticated in
  the browser session.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-021 by adding `/v1/connection` and `/connection`
  so service adapters can verify API key auth, workspace identity,
  capabilities, and safe ClickUp configuration status before syncing or writing
  operational records.
