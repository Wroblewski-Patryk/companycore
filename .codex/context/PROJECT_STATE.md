# PROJECT_STATE

Last updated: 2026-05-02

## Product Snapshot
- Name: LuckySparrow Company Core
- Goal: Central backend for company projects, goals, tasks, CRM, notes,
  decisions, agents, and system events.
- Commercial model: Internal operational infrastructure.
- Current phase: v1 foundation.

## Product Decisions (Confirmed)
- 2026-05-02: No GUI in v1.
- 2026-05-02: PostgreSQL is the source of truth.
- 2026-05-02: API is the only supported access layer.
- 2026-05-02: CompanyCore owns the first native integration adapter:
  ClickUp -> CompanyCore -> PostgreSQL -> event. n8n remains optional for
  orchestration only when a workflow is better outside the backend.
- 2026-05-02: v1 must include an ownership boundary: registration creates a
  workspace and an owner user, and integration settings/secrets belong to the
  workspace rather than global process state.

## Technical Baseline
- Backend: Node.js 22, Express, TypeScript.
- Frontend: None.
- Mobile: None.
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma.
- Infra: Docker Compose.
- Hosting target: Coolify-compatible Docker Compose.
- Deployment shape: backend + postgres.
- Runtime services: `backend`, `postgres`.
- Background jobs / workers: None in v1.
- Persistent storage: Docker volume `companycore_postgres`.
- Health / readiness checks: `GET /health`.
- Environment files: `.env.example`.
- Observability: minimal system events table.
- MCP / external tools: ClickUp API is called by a native CompanyCore
  integration adapter; n8n may call API endpoints for optional orchestration.
- Auth / ownership: planned v1 workspace owner model with user registration,
  login, workspace-scoped API access, and workspace-scoped integration
  settings.

## Validation Commands
- Lint: Not configured.
- Typecheck: `npm run build`
- Unit tests: Not configured in v1.
- Integration tests: manual HTTP smoke against Docker Compose.
- E2E / smoke: `GET /health`, register owner/workspace, authenticate, create
  project, create task, configure workspace ClickUp settings, trigger native
  ClickUp sync, verify synced task and event.
- Other high-risk checks: `docker compose up -d --build`

## Deployment Contract
- Primary deploy path: Docker Compose.
- Coolify app/service layout: one backend service plus one Postgres service.
- Dockerfiles / compose paths: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`.
- Required secrets: `DATABASE_URL`, `SEED_API_KEY`, app auth secrets, optional
  `PORT`; ClickUp tokens must be stored as workspace integration settings, not
  hardcoded process globals.
- Public URLs / ports: backend on `3000`; deployed domains to document and
  verify are `companycore.luckysparrow.ch` and
  `api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch`.
- Backup / restore expectation: Postgres volume backups required before
  production use.
- Rollback trigger and method: redeploy previous image/commit and preserve
  Postgres volume.

## Current Focus
- Main active objective: define the API contract and error response standard
  before expanding auth, workspace, and integration routes.
- Top blockers: native ClickUp integration contract needs design before
  implementation; production migration policy is undecided; API namespace and
  API key hardening implementation details remain open; API/error contracts and
  workspace guardrail tests need definition before route surface expands.
- Success criteria for this phase: canonical docs, workspace/auth model,
  task board, planning queue, deployment domains, migration strategy, event
  coverage, API/error contracts, regression guardrails, tests, observability,
  and deployment smoke evidence are aligned.

## Autonomous Iteration State
- Current iteration: CCV1-014 API contract and error response standard.
- Current operation mode: ARCHITECT
- Last completed iteration: CCV1-011 workspace ownership and auth architecture
  contract.
- Last completed task: finalized v1 owner/workspace/auth architecture decisions
  and documented workspace-scoped business data, API keys, and integration
  settings.
- Next required mode: ARCHITECT for CCV1-003 if following iteration rotation.

## Recent Progress
- 2026-05-02: Created Company Core backend foundation, Prisma schema, Docker
  runtime, API key auth, minimal endpoints, ClickUp sync, event logging, and
  docs.
- 2026-05-02: Audited repository against CompanyCore v1 expectations. Confirmed
  build passes and identified planning/doc drift, missing event types,
  migration risk, plaintext API key storage, missing deployment domains, and
  incomplete route modules.
- 2026-05-02: Converted audit findings into the CCV1 task queue and task
  contracts under `docs/planning/`.
- 2026-05-02: Revised integration direction by user decision: CompanyCore v1
  should implement native ClickUp integration directly instead of requiring
  n8n workflows as the primary path.
- 2026-05-02: Revised auth/ownership direction by user decision: v1 should
  create a workspace with an owner user during registration, and workspace
  settings should own integration configuration such as ClickUp credentials.
- 2026-05-02: Added regression-prevention plan covering API contracts,
  workspace guardrail tests, migration/bootstrap safety, integration adapter
  contracts, and observability minimums.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-001 by replacing canonical architecture and
  Coolify deployment placeholders with CompanyCore-specific architecture and
  operations truth.
- 2026-05-02: Completed CCV1-011 by documenting owner email/password auth,
  workspace creation at registration, owner-only membership for v1, and
  workspace-scoped service API keys.

## Working Agreements
- Keep task board and project state synchronized.
- Keep planning docs synchronized with task board.
- Keep changes small and reversible.
- Validate touched areas before marking done.
- Keep repository artifacts in English.
- Communicate with users in their language.
- Treat deployment docs and smoke checks as part of done-state for runtime
  changes.
