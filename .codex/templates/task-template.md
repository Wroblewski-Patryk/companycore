## Process Self-Audit
- [ ] All seven autonomous loop steps are planned.
- [ ] No loop step is being skipped.
- [ ] Exactly one priority task is selected.
- [ ] Operation mode matches the iteration number.
- [ ] The task is aligned with repository source-of-truth documents.
- [ ] `.agents/core/project-memory-index.md` was reviewed.
- [ ] `.agents/core/mission-control.md` was reviewed for long-running work.
- [ ] Missing or template-like state tables were bootstrapped from repository
      sources, or confirmed not needed.
- [ ] Affected module confidence rows were identified.
- [ ] Affected requirement, quality scenario, and risk rows were identified or
      marked not applicable.
- [ ] The task or mission improves release confidence, not only local code appearance.

## Mission Block

## Context
Where this work sits in the current project flow and architecture.

## Goal
What must be achieved by this task.

## Scope
Exact files, modules, routes, APIs, schemas, docs, or runtime surfaces allowed
for this task.

## Implementation Plan
1. Inspect the existing architecture, code, contracts, and tests before
   changing files.
2. Implement only the minimal vertical slice required by the goal.
3. Validate integration, error handling, restart or reload behavior, and
   regression risk.
4. Update documentation and task evidence.

## Deliverable For This Stage
Describe exactly what should be produced in the current stage only.

## Constraints
- use existing systems and approved mechanisms
- do not introduce new structures without approval
- do not implement workarounds
- do not duplicate logic
- stay within the declared current stage unless explicit approval changes it
- no placeholders, mock-only paths, or temporary solutions in delivered
  behavior
- implement features as a vertical slice across UI, logic, API, DB, validation,
  error handling, and tests when the task affects runtime behavior

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code builds without errors.
- [ ] Feature works manually through the real UI, API, CLI, or operator path.
- [ ] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary data/path remains.
- [ ] Full data flow works across all relevant layers.
- [ ] Backend and UI/client error handling exists where applicable.
- [ ] No existing functionality is broken.
- [ ] Feature works after restart, reload, or navigation refresh where
  applicable.
- [ ] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [ ] Behavior is reproducible from the evidence recorded below.
- [ ] Success signal, reliability, security, and rollback evidence are recorded
  when applicable.
- [ ] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

## Stage Exit Criteria

- [ ] Work from later stages was not mixed in without explicit approval.
- [ ] Risks and assumptions for this stage are stated clearly.
