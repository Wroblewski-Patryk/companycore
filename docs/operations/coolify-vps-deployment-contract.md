# Coolify VPS Deployment Contract

CompanyCore v1 deploys as a single backend Docker Compose application on a
Coolify-compatible VPS. The same backend serves a minimal owner web console on
the web domain and the JSON API on the API domain. The deployment must preserve
PostgreSQL data.

## Deployment Target

- VPS provider: LuckySparrow-managed VPS.
- Platform: Coolify.
- Public domains:
  - Web UI: `companycore.luckysparrow.ch`
  - API: `api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch`
- Public service: `backend` on container port `3000`.
- Public web surface: minimal owner console served by `backend` at `/`.
- Private services: `postgres`.

## Runtime Inventory

- Main app services:
  - `backend`: Node.js/Express API plus minimal static owner console.
  - `postgres`: PostgreSQL database.
- Worker or cron services: none in v1.
- Databases: PostgreSQL 16.
- Cache or queue: none in v1.
- Persistent volumes:
  - `companycore_postgres` mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql/data`.

## Required Artifacts

- Dockerfile path: `Dockerfile`.
- Local Compose path: `docker-compose.yml`.
- Coolify Compose path: `docker-compose.coolify.yml`.
- Env example file: `.env.example`.
- Health/readiness endpoint: `GET /health`.
- Owner console: `GET https://companycore.luckysparrow.ch/`.
- API metadata: `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/`.
- Migration entrypoint:
  - Runtime startup runs `npm run prisma:migrate:deploy`.
  - Local development may use `npm run prisma:migrate:dev`.
  - `prisma db push` is not the production deploy path.
  - Existing production databases that predate Prisma migration history must
    be baselined once in `_prisma_migrations` only after table shape is
    verified against the baseline migration.

## Env And Secrets Contract

Current foundation secrets:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SERVICE_PASSWORD_POSTGRES`
- `SERVICE_PASSWORD_API_KEY` or `SEED_API_KEY`
- `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`
- `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET`
- `INTEGRATION_SECRET_KEY`
- optional `PORT`

v1 service credentials:

- workspace-scoped service API keys for Paperclip, Jarvis, n8n, and other
  agents

ClickUp configuration:

- ClickUp tokens, list IDs, team IDs, and sync configuration should be stored
  as workspace-owned integration settings.
- Only app-level encryption or runtime secrets belong in Coolify env.
- ClickUp tokens must not be hardcoded, logged, or returned in API responses.
- For production bootstrap, use `npm run clickup:bootstrap` with temporary
  operator env values documented in
  `docs/operations/clickup-production-bootstrap.md`. Do not add
  `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN` as a permanent backend runtime env unless a scheduled
  sync worker is explicitly approved.

## Release Requirements

Required checks before deploy:

- `npm run build`
- migration review for schema changes
- migration validation against empty and existing database shapes when schema
  changes touch ownership, auth, API keys, integrations, tasks, or external ID
  uniqueness
- relevant endpoint/integration tests once CCV1-006 is implemented
- `git diff --check` before commit/release handoff

Required smoke checks after deploy:

- `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/health`
- `GET https://companycore.luckysparrow.ch/`
- `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/`
- owner registration/login or approved first-owner bootstrap
- protected workspace-scoped project/task call
- denied unauthenticated or cross-workspace request
- workspace ClickUp settings response with secrets redacted
- owner console guided ClickUp discovery and settings save
- native ClickUp sync
- event readback showing expected sync event

Rollback trigger:

- failed health check
- failed owner/auth bootstrap
- failed migration that risks data ownership
- failed protected API path
- failed ClickUp sync that corrupts or duplicates data

Rollback method:

- redeploy previous image/commit
- preserve the PostgreSQL volume
- restore database from backup if migration or data corruption occurred
- record the incident and add a regression check before retrying

Production baseline recovery:

- Prisma `P3005` means the database is not empty and migration history is
  missing; it is not a reason to delete the PostgreSQL volume.
- Verify existing tables first, then baseline only the migration that exactly
  matches the existing schema.
- After baseline, redeploy the latest commit and verify backend logs show
  migration success before running protected smoke.

First-owner bootstrap:

- Prefer `POST /auth/register` when public registration is temporarily allowed
  and immediately protect/disable that path if deployment policy requires it.
- Alternatively run `npm run seed` once with explicit production bootstrap
  secrets.
- After bootstrap, rotate temporary owner password/API key material if it was
  shared through deployment tooling.
- Do not rely on repeat production seed runs as an admin access mechanism.

## Data Safety

- Backup strategy: take Postgres volume/database backups before risky
  production migrations.
- Restore verification expectation: periodically verify backup restore path
  before relying on production data.
- Risky migration policy: any migration that changes ownership, auth, API key,
  integration settings, or external ID uniqueness must include rollback or
  recovery notes.

## Observability And Logs

Minimum v1 logs/signals:

- backend startup and migration failures
- auth failures without logging credentials
- workspace scoping failures without leaking record details
- integration settings changes without logging secret values
- ClickUp sync start, success, failure, and item counts
- event creation failures

Provider tokens, API keys, passwords, and raw secret material must never be
logged.
