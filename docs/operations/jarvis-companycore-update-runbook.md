# Jarvis CompanyCore Update Runbook

This runbook explains how to update the production OpenJarvis application so
Jarvis can use CompanyCore as a Data Source and chat context provider.

## Purpose

Jarvis should be able to answer company-memory questions from CompanyCore,
including Paperclip onboarding records, decisions, tasks, notes, agents, and
events. CompanyCore remains the source of truth. OpenJarvis reads it through
the authenticated CompanyCore HTTP API.

## Source Files

The OpenJarvis runtime change lives in the OpenJarvis repository, not in this
CompanyCore repository:

- `src/openjarvis/connectors/companycore.py`
- `src/openjarvis/server/companycore_context.py`
- `src/openjarvis/connectors/__init__.py`
- `src/openjarvis/server/connectors_router.py`
- `src/openjarvis/server/routes.py`
- `tests/connectors/test_companycore.py`
- `tests/server/test_companycore_context.py`

CompanyCore tracks the deployment state and evidence here:

- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md`

## Required Runtime Environment

Production Jarvis must have these environment variables:

- `COMPANYCORE_BASE_URL=https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch`
- `COMPANYCORE_API_KEY=<Jarvis workspace service API key>`
- `COMPANYCORE_ADAPTER_SOURCE=jarvis`

Do not commit or document raw service API keys. CompanyCore raw keys are
one-time secret material and should only be stored in the target runtime
environment.

## Local Validation

Run the targeted OpenJarvis tests before deploying:

```powershell
cd C:\Personal\Projekty\Aplikacje\OpenJarvis
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests\connectors\test_companycore.py tests\server\test_companycore_context.py -q
```

Expected result:

```text
4 passed
```

Also run syntax validation for the touched server files when doing a narrow
hotfix:

```powershell
cd C:\Personal\Projekty\Aplikacje\OpenJarvis
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m py_compile `
  src\openjarvis\connectors\companycore.py `
  src\openjarvis\server\companycore_context.py `
  src\openjarvis\server\routes.py `
  src\openjarvis\server\connectors_router.py
```

## Production Deployment Path

The current production app is a Docker Compose deployment on the VPS.

- SSH host alias: `codex-vps`
- Source checkout: `/home/codex/apps/openjarvis`
- Compose app: `/home/codex/apps/openjarvis-prod`
- Jarvis container: `openjarvis-prod-jarvis-1`
- Public URL: `https://jarvis.luckysparrow.ch`

Deploy from the VPS:

```bash
ssh codex-vps
cd /home/codex/apps/openjarvis-prod
docker compose up -d --build jarvis
```

Check container status and recent logs:

```bash
docker ps --filter name=openjarvis-prod-jarvis-1
docker logs --tail 120 openjarvis-prod-jarvis-1
```

Expected result:

- container is `Up`
- server starts with `Engine: cloud`
- Uvicorn listens on `0.0.0.0:8000`

## Connector Smoke

Login to production Jarvis and keep the cookie in a temporary file:

```powershell
$cookie = Join-Path $env:TEMP "jarvis-cookies-codex.txt"
$body = Join-Path $env:TEMP "jarvis-login.json"
Set-Content -LiteralPath $body `
  -Value '{"username":"jarvis","password":"<runtime password>"}' `
  -Encoding ASCII
curl.exe -sk -c $cookie -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  --data-binary "@$body" `
  "https://jarvis.luckysparrow.ch/auth/login"
Remove-Item $body -Force
```

Verify the connector:

```powershell
curl.exe -sk -b $cookie "https://jarvis.luckysparrow.ch/v1/connectors/companycore"
```

Expected result:

```json
{
  "connector_id": "companycore",
  "display_name": "CompanyCore",
  "auth_type": "bridge",
  "connected": true
}
```

Trigger a sync:

```powershell
curl.exe -sk -b $cookie -X POST "https://jarvis.luckysparrow.ch/v1/connectors/companycore/sync"
```

Then list connectors and confirm that `companycore` has indexed chunks:

```powershell
curl.exe -sk -b $cookie "https://jarvis.luckysparrow.ch/v1/connectors"
```

Expected result:

- `companycore.connected` is `true`
- `companycore.chunks` is greater than `0`

## Chat Smoke

Ask Jarvis a question that requires CompanyCore records:

```powershell
$body = Join-Path $env:TEMP "jarvis-chat-companycore.json"
@'
{
  "model": "default",
  "stream": false,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Na podstawie CompanyCore powiedz, co wiesz o projekcie Paperclip AI onboarding to CompanyCore. Wymien decyzje, dwa zadania i agenta."
    }
  ]
}
'@ | Set-Content -LiteralPath $body -Encoding UTF8

curl.exe -sk -b $cookie -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  --data-binary "@$body" `
  "https://jarvis.luckysparrow.ch/v1/chat/completions"

Remove-Item $body -Force
```

The answer should mention:

- project `Paperclip AI onboarding to CompanyCore`
- decision `Use CompanyCore API as the agent source of truth`
- task `Teach Jarvis to summarize CompanyCore records`
- task `Reuse the same CompanyCore adapter path in Paperclip`
- agent `Jarvis production chat adapter`

The CompanyCore context injector filters smoke/test records from ordinary
business prompts unless the user explicitly asks about smoke or tests. If smoke
records dominate this answer again, treat it as a Jarvis answer precision
regression.

Do not mark the task done until this chat smoke passes.

## Common Failure Modes

### Connector is missing

If `/v1/connectors/companycore` returns `404`, the production image does not
include the OpenJarvis connector registration. Verify:

- `src/openjarvis/connectors/companycore.py` exists in the source checkout
- `src/openjarvis/connectors/__init__.py` imports `openjarvis.connectors.companycore`
- the Jarvis image was rebuilt, not only restarted

### Connector is disconnected

If `connected=false`, verify runtime env in the container:

```bash
docker exec openjarvis-prod-jarvis-1 printenv | grep COMPANYCORE
```

The connector must call CompanyCore with `X-API-Key`, not `Authorization:
Bearer`. A `401 invalid_auth_token` usually means the wrong auth header was
used or the service key is invalid for this workspace.

### Sync succeeds but chat does not answer from CompanyCore

Confirm that the chat context injector is deployed:

- `src/openjarvis/server/routes.py` imports
  `maybe_inject_companycore_context`
- the chat route calls `maybe_inject_companycore_context(request_body)` before
  model execution
- the user prompt contains a CompanyCore-related keyword such as
  `CompanyCore`, `Paperclip`, `projekt`, `zadanie`, `decyzja`, or `agent`

## Documentation Updates After Deployment

After a successful update, refresh these files:

- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md` when new smoke evidence is material

Record only key prefixes or IDs when needed. Never record raw API keys,
session cookies, database passwords, or login passwords.
