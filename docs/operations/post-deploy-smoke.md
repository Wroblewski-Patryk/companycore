# Post-Deploy Smoke

Use this file to record the minimum checks after each deploy.

## Global Checks

- [x] `https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/health` returns success
- [ ] `https://companycore.luckysparrow.ch` reaches the configured project
  surface or intentional backend/API response
- [x] `https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch` reaches the backend API
- [x] Logs show no startup crash loop
- [x] No unexpected worker checks are required because v1 has no workers

## User Journey Checks

- [ ] Owner registration/login or approved first-owner bootstrap works
- [ ] Protected project/task API call works with owner token or workspace API
  key
- [x] Missing auth is denied
- [ ] ClickUp integration settings can be read without returning token material
- [ ] Native ClickUp sync creates or updates at least one task when credentials
  and list IDs are configured
- [ ] `GET /events` includes `task_synced_from_clickup` and sync status events

## Ops Checks

- [x] Migrations completed successfully
- [ ] Required env values are present
- [ ] Metrics or error tracking show no new critical issue
- [ ] Rollback target is known and PostgreSQL volume preservation is confirmed
- [ ] If migration or data corruption occurs, restore from backup instead of
  deleting the Postgres volume

## Evidence

- Timestamp: 2026-05-02
- Environment: production public domains
- Domains checked:
  - `companycore.luckysparrow.ch`
  - `api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch`
- Commands run:
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/health`
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/health`
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/projects` without auth
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/projects` without auth
  - `GET https://companycore.luckysparrow.ch`
- Screenshots or logs:
  - `GET /health` returned `{ "status": "ok", "service": "companycore",
    "name": "LuckySparrow Company Core" }`.
  - `GET /v1/health` returned `401 Unauthorized`; this indicates production is
    not yet running the current v1 route build where `/v1/health` is public.
  - `GET /v1/projects` without auth returned `401 Unauthorized`, which is the
    expected negative path for protected API routes.
  - `GET /projects` without auth returned `401 Unauthorized`, which is the
    expected negative path for protected compatibility routes.
  - `GET companycore.luckysparrow.ch` returned `401 Unauthorized`; acceptable
    only if this domain intentionally points at the protected API surface.
- Residual risks:
  - Full CCV1-009 cannot be marked done until the latest commits are deployed
    and production credentials are available for protected owner/API-key,
    ClickUp settings, native sync, and event readback checks.

## Production Recovery Evidence

- Timestamp: 2026-05-02
- Environment: Coolify production, Root Team, `companycore (localhost)`
- Deployment:
  - Forced redeploy `r4hgrbmh5obfvz9v61mlbgyc`.
  - Coolify imported commit `3f64a72da107c112c4ced8f0ba7aa88602650c2a`.
  - Deployment finished and the application status changed to `Running`.
- Recovery action:
  - Production PostgreSQL already contained the foundation schema but lacked
    `_prisma_migrations`.
  - Added a one-time Prisma baseline row for
    `202605021_v1_foundation` with checksum
    `097fade7aa0850b167c9a76966742759deb85a5358e1ff11def2f5bd29b247c3`.
  - Preserved the existing PostgreSQL volume and did not delete business data.
- Logs:
  - Backend log after redeploy:
    - `7 migrations found in prisma/migrations`
    - `No pending migrations to apply.`
    - `npm run seed`
    - `companycore listening on port 3000`
- Public checks:
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/health` returned `200`.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/health` returned `200`.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/projects` without auth
    returned `401`, which is the expected protected-route negative path.
- Residual risks:
  - Protected production smoke still needs an approved owner token or
    workspace API key plus configured ClickUp workspace settings.

## Workspace Scope Deployment Evidence

- Timestamp: 2026-05-02
- Environment: Coolify production, Root Team, `companycore (localhost)`
- Deployment:
  - Manual redeploy `zibcl0a0rih1vmhig3vkf4ce`.
  - Coolify imported commit `1d6f21abc8da90c83cdab32ea279ce3872d574b2`.
  - Deployment finished and the application status stayed `Running`.
- Logs:
  - Backend log after redeploy:
    - `8 migrations found in prisma/migrations`
    - `Applying migration 202605028_workspace_core_records`
    - `All migrations have been successfully applied.`
    - `npm run seed`
    - `companycore listening on port 3000`
- Public checks:
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/health` returned `200`.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/health` returned `200`.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/projects` without auth
    returned `401`, which is the expected protected-route negative path.
- Auto-deploy note:
  - Coolify `Auto Deploy` is enabled.
  - No deployment was created automatically after pushing `1d6f21a`.
  - GitHub was not logged in in the browser, so repository webhook creation
    could not be completed from this session.

## Adapter Connection Deployment Evidence

- Timestamp: 2026-05-02
- Environment: Coolify production, Root Team, `companycore (localhost)`
- Deployment:
  - Manual redeploy `qn7wcxnony0jdm2o2q4ex7rc`.
  - Coolify imported commit `4a4554f`.
  - Manual redeploy for commit `c564d0a` finished successfully after the
    adapter manifest change.
- Public checks:
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/health` returned `200`.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/connection` without auth
    returned `401`, which is the expected protected-route negative path.
- Residual risks:
  - Full protected adapter handshake still needs a real production workspace
    service API key.

## Agents API Deployment Evidence

- Timestamp: 2026-05-02
- Environment: Coolify production, Root Team, `companycore (localhost)`
- Deployment:
  - Manual redeploy was queued by Coolify, then force-started from the
    CompanyCore deployment detail page.
  - Coolify imported commit `ebc660b3761464c4571cfba822d22c2a2923b5d8`.
  - Deployment finished, created new backend/postgres containers, and the app
    status stayed `Running`.
- Public checks:
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/health` returned `200`.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/agents` without auth
    returned `401`, which is the expected protected-route negative path.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/connection` without auth
    returned `401`, which is the expected protected-route negative path.
- Residual risks:
  - Full protected agent creation and connection manifest smoke still needs a
    real production workspace service API key.

## Adapter CRUD Deployment Evidence

- Timestamp: 2026-05-03
- Environment: Coolify production, Root Team, `companycore (localhost)`
- Deployment:
  - Manual redeploy imported commit `decd899`.
  - Deployment was in progress at `2026-05-02 22:18:26 UTC` and public smoke
    passed after the rollout window.
- Public checks:
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/health` returned `200`.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/task-lists` without auth
    returned `401`, which is the expected protected-route negative path.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/pipeline-stages` without
    auth returned `401`, which is the expected protected-route negative path.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/interactions` without auth
    returned `401`, which is the expected protected-route negative path.
- Residual risks:
  - Full protected CRUD smoke still needs a real production workspace service
    API key. Use `npm run adapter:smoke` once that key exists.

## Protected Adapter Smoke Evidence

- Timestamp: 2026-05-03
- Environment: production API, workspace `LuckySparrow`
  (`00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000100`)
- Credential path:
  - SSH access to the VPS was verified through `plink`.
  - A fresh hash-only service API key named
    `Paperclip/Jarvis production adapter` was created in the production
    database through the running backend container.
  - The raw key was used for smoke only and was not printed in docs.
  - Key prefix: `cc_v1_LxSo`
  - API key id: `d64ab750-b6e7-4806-96b3-8e64eadeb37d`
- Command run:
  - `npm run adapter:smoke` with
    `COMPANYCORE_BASE_URL=https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch`
- Result:
  - `/v1/connection` succeeded.
  - Created agent `7e651b64-5bc1-4013-8f4e-fa68ece8da29`.
  - Created task list `db2b6b31-bcda-44f0-8ee1-651785c2f7df`.
  - Created task `19b3f439-eb18-477b-821c-d0fb59162a0b`.
  - Created interaction `d1a38820-8961-44a3-81bb-f384b90f3144`.
  - Created agent log `5d9d5f26-4aae-4dbe-b2d2-02e8fa50722b`.
  - `/v1/events` contained the expected adapter event types.
- Residual risks:
  - The service key value is not recoverable from CompanyCore because raw keys
    are shown only once by design. To wire Paperclip/Jarvis directly, create a
    dedicated key per adapter through `/v1/api-keys` or create/store a fresh
    key directly in each adapter's secret environment.

## Paperclip And Jarvis Environment Wiring Evidence

- Timestamp: 2026-05-03
- Environment: production VPS Docker Compose apps
- Target containers:
  - `paperclip-prod-paperclip-1`
  - `openjarvis-prod-jarvis-1`
- Credential path:
  - Created separate hash-only service API keys in CompanyCore for:
    - `Paperclip production adapter`
    - `Jarvis production adapter`
  - Stored raw keys only in the target app `.env` files on the VPS.
  - Recreated both application containers with Docker Compose so new env values
    are visible at runtime.
- CompanyCore env visible in containers:
  - Paperclip:
    - `COMPANYCORE_BASE_URL=https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch`
    - `COMPANYCORE_ADAPTER_SOURCE=paperclip`
    - `COMPANYCORE_API_KEY` prefix `cc_v1_qUZK`
  - Jarvis:
    - `COMPANYCORE_BASE_URL=https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch`
    - `COMPANYCORE_ADAPTER_SOURCE=jarvis`
    - `COMPANYCORE_API_KEY` prefix `cc_v1_GaF4`
- Protected smoke:
  - Paperclip key passed `npm run adapter:smoke`.
  - Jarvis key passed `npm run adapter:smoke`.
- Residual risks:
  - Paperclip and Jarvis application code still needs to read these env vars
    and call CompanyCore through its adapter layer. Infrastructure wiring is
    complete.

## Local Docker Reproduction Evidence

- Timestamp: 2026-05-02
- Environment: local production-like Docker Compose
- Commands run:
  - `docker compose down -v`
  - `docker compose up --build -d`
  - `docker compose logs backend --tail=160`
  - `GET http://localhost:3000/health`
  - `GET http://localhost:3000/v1/health`
- Result:
  - Reproduced production startup failures before the hotfix:
    - seed could not import helpers from `src/` because runtime image only
      copied `dist` and `prisma`
    - Prisma Client was not generated in runtime because `node_modules` came
      from the dependency stage before `prisma generate`
  - After the hotfix, local Docker startup applied all migrations, ran seed,
    logged `companycore listening on port 3000`, and both `/health` and
    `/v1/health` returned `ok`.
- Residual risks:
  - Production still needs redeploy from the fixed commit and protected smoke
    with real owner/API-key and ClickUp workspace settings.

## Guided ClickUp Owner Console Deployment Evidence

- Timestamp: 2026-05-03
- Environment: Coolify production, Root Team, `companycore`
- Deployment:
  - Manual redeploy `i12v0znlzq4twrl509iuqwmo`.
  - Coolify imported commit `b46a96071f2c5a6b8c17bc725940ba60122f658f`.
  - Backend container image tag is
    `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:b46a96071f2c5a6b8c17bc725940ba60122f658f`.
  - A temporary Coolify deploy API token was created for the redeploy and
    deleted after the API call.
- Public checks:
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/health` returned `200`.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/` returned `200` and served
    the `CompanyCore Integrations` / `ClickUp connection` owner console.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/app.js` returned `200`.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/styles.css` returned `200`.
  - `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/connection` without auth
    returned `401`, which is the expected protected-route negative path.
  - `POST https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/auth/login` with the seeded
    owner account returned `200`.
- Residual risks:
  - A real ClickUp token was not available in this session, so the first
    provider discovery, Workspace/List selection, settings save, and native
    pull sync still need to be performed by the owner through the deployed
    console.
  - Continuous ClickUp updates are not enabled yet. CCV1-034 must decide
    scheduled pull sync versus webhook ingestion after the first production
    ClickUp pull succeeds.
