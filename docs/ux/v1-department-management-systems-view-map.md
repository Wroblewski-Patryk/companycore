# V1 Department Management Systems View Map

Last updated: 2026-05-16

## Purpose

This document defines the V1 web view map for CompanyCore after accepting the
department management systems direction. It refreshes the view list so the app
can evolve from separate modules into one coherent company operating system.

Architecture source:

- `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-v1-blueprint.md`
- `docs/architecture/companycore-global-business-flow.md`
- `docs/architecture/companycore-business-module-map.md`

## View Layers

CompanyCore V1 has three web layers:

| Layer | Audience | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public | visitors and owner before login | explain the product and allow safe entry. |
| Private owner | owner/operator | operate the company through the Company Atlas and department systems. |
| Agent-facing support | owner plus supervised agents | expose what agents can read/do, what needs approval, and what evidence exists. |

## Public Views

| View | Route | Purpose | V1 status | Primary components |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public Home | `/` | Explain CompanyCore and route to login/register. | V1 canonical | value statement, product signal, login/register actions |
| Owner Login | `/auth/login` | Safe owner return path. | V1 canonical | login form, pending route recovery, workspace safety copy |
| Owner Registration | `/auth/register` | First owner and workspace bootstrap. | V1 canonical | registration form, workspace creation, onboarding cue |

## Private Core Views

| View | Route | Purpose | V1 status | Primary components |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Company Atlas | `/dashboard` | Whole-company command map across 00-12 areas. | V1 canonical | company decision board, area map, health signals, next action |
| Operations Cockpit | `/operations` | Cross-perspective supervision for clients, tasks, files/tables, and AI handoff. | V1 canonical | four-lane command surface, quick create, department evidence, AI handoff |
| Department Management System | `/areas?area=:areaKey&view=:viewId` | Canonical department operating room for one area. | V1 canonical base; `00 Main` and `04 Operacje` have first dedicated read-only management panels | department identity, command brief, subsystem tabs, board, evidence rail |
| Unified Settings | `/settings` | Configure connectors, agent keys, and MCP handoff fields. | V1 canonical | integration settings, agent keys, MCP instructions |

## Private Support Workbenches

These support department systems and should be progressively rebuilt around the
department management model.

| View | Route | Current status | Target role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All-Areas Admin Workbench | `/areas` | V0 rebuild | Manage operating-area mappings and lifecycle, not the primary department view. |
| Task Delivery Workbench | `/tasks-adapter` | V1 canonical | Execution pressure and task operations for department systems. |
| Data Evidence Browser | `/data`, `/data/:table` | V0 rebuild | Area-aware table/record evidence browser. |
| Relationship Review | `/relationships` | V0 rebuild | Area-aware relationship provenance and confidence review. |
| Pipeline Workbench | `/pipeline` | V0 rebuild | Workflow and sales/delivery pipeline management by area. |
| Company OS Cockpit | `/react-company-os` | V1 foundation | Command/evidence cockpit for workflows, approvals, audit, and standards. |
| Agent Tool Surface | `/react-agent-tools` | V1 canonical section entry | MCP tool handoff from settings, later area-aware agent view. |
| Account Settings | `/settings/account` | V0 rebuild | Workspace/account administration. |

## Department System Routes

All department systems use:

```text
/areas?area=:areaKey&view=:viewId
```

Default `viewId` values:

```text
overview
goals
workflows
tasks
records
knowledge
resources
metrics
risks
decisions
ai
improvements
```

The current implementation already supports a subset of capability tabs. V1
should expand toward the full set as existing backend contracts allow it.

## Department View Component Contract

Every department route should be composed from these groups:

| Zone | Component group | Required content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header | Department identity bar | name, role, value-flow contribution, health, active owner/agent focus |
| Top board | Management command brief | what matters now, blocker/risk, next owner decision, suggested AI action |
| Navigation | Subsystem tabs | overview, goals, workflows, tasks, records, knowledge, resources, metrics, risks, decisions, AI, improvements |
| Main | Primary management board | subsystem-specific cards, tables, pipeline preview, task list, action panels |
| Right rail | Evidence and graph rail | linked records, Drive files, knowledge, pipeline runs, events, audit, relationship confidence |
| Bottom | Improvement loop | feedback, retro notes, improvement tasks, standards/process updates |

## Per-Department UX Requirements

| System | Must answer first | Must not do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Company Orchestration | What needs owner attention across the whole company? | Become a duplicate of every department board. |
| Strategy | Which goals and decisions steer the company now? | Hide execution blockers from strategic decisions. |
| Product And Delivery | What value is promised, being built, and accepted? | Split products and services into unrelated systems. |
| Work Execution | What is blocked, overdue, assigned, or ready to move? | Show tasks without ownership, area, or evidence. |
| Sales | Which opportunities need qualification, discovery, offer, or follow-up? | Mix sales with generic relationship support without stage clarity. |
| Relationships | Which clients/stakeholders need care, support, or expansion? | Treat clients as only sales leads. |
| Finance | Which delivered value needs invoice/payment/closure? | Add payment actions without finance/security contracts. |
| People/Agents And Roles | Which human or agent unit owns the work, capacity, authority, and escalation? | Use PAEI as permission or authority. |
| Operations | Which routines, controls, and procedures keep the company running? | Become a dumping ground for unowned work. |
| Knowledge | What does the company know, decide, and need to learn? | Store knowledge without source, ownership, or freshness. |
| Assets | Which files, tools, repos, prompts, and resources are addressable? | Expose raw provider complexity before company meaning. |
| Integrations | Which providers and automations are connected and healthy? | Let providers become the product model. |
| AI Agents | What can agents read/do, and what needs supervision? | Let agents bypass approvals, audit, or CompanyCore APIs. |

## V1 Build Sequence

1. Publish the shared department-system architecture and prompt pack.
2. Update the selected-area route spec so each area is a department management
   system, not a generic area detail.
3. Refresh Company Atlas copy and route metadata to point to department
   systems.
4. Build read-only department shell consistency for all 13 systems.
5. Deepen one system at a time, starting from existing backend contracts:
   Strategy, Sales, Work Execution, Knowledge, AI Agents.
6. Add write actions only where current APIs already support safe scoped
   behavior.
7. Add Paperclip/MCP department packets after human-readable department
   read models are stable.

## Prompt Pack Link

Use `docs/ux/v1-department-system-prompt-pack.md` for generation and
implementation prompts.

## Detailed Department Blueprint

Use `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-v1-blueprint.md` before
building each department. It defines the 12 operating department systems,
`00 Main` orchestration, shared layout, backend reuse rules, backend gap
register, agent packets, and recommended build order.
