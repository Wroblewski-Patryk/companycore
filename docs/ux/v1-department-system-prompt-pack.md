# V1 Department System Prompt Pack

Last updated: 2026-05-16

## Purpose

Use these prompts to generate consistent specs, visual concepts, UI slices, and
agent-facing implementation plans for CompanyCore V1 department management
systems.

This pack is intentionally reusable. Each prompt should be filled with one
department system from:

- `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-architecture.md`
- `docs/ux/v1-department-management-systems-view-map.md`

## Shared Context Block

Use this context at the top of every prompt:

```text
CompanyCore is an AI-first company operating system for LuckySparrow.
The app uses a Company Atlas with 13 areas: 00 Main plus 12 departments.
Each department is a Department Management System, not just a tab or filtered table.
Each system reuses shared CompanyCore modules: goals, tasks, processes, pipelines, tables, records, knowledge, resources, metrics, risks, decisions, approvals, events, audit logs, and AI/MCP tools.
The department view must fit the V1 selected-area route:
/areas?area=:areaKey&view=:viewId
The UI must be useful for a human owner and also produce clear context for Paperclip and other supervised AI agents.
Do not invent fake data, raw provider shortcuts, broad CRUD, or separate subsystem databases.
Use existing backend contracts first and mark missing contracts explicitly.
```

## Master UX Spec Prompt

```text
Create a V1 UX specification for the [DEPARTMENT_SYSTEM_NAME].

Department:
- Area key: [AREA_KEY]
- User-facing label: [LABEL]
- Primary value-flow contribution: [VALUE_FLOW_LAYER]
- Core subsystems: [SUBSYSTEM_LIST]

Use the CompanyCore department management system architecture.
The output must include:
1. The department purpose in one sentence.
2. The owner question answered in the first 3 seconds.
3. The standard layout zones:
   - Department identity bar
   - Management command brief
   - Subsystem navigation
   - Primary management board
   - Evidence and graph rail
   - Improvement loop
4. A component inventory for each zone.
5. Empty, loading, error, blocked, success, and degraded states.
6. Desktop, tablet, and mobile behavior.
7. Data sources from existing CompanyCore modules.
8. Actions allowed now from existing backend contracts.
9. Actions that must wait for future backend contracts.
10. Paperclip/AI agent packet: what the agent may read, propose, execute, and what needs owner approval.
11. Risks and anti-patterns.
12. Acceptance criteria for a V1 implementation.

Keep the spec concrete, implementation-facing, and consistent with CompanyCore V1.
```

## Visual Concept Prompt

```text
Create a high-fidelity product UI concept for the CompanyCore [DEPARTMENT_SYSTEM_NAME].

Route:
/areas?area=[AREA_KEY]&view=overview

Style:
Quiet professional SaaS operating-system UI, dense but readable, no marketing hero, no decorative blobs, no fake charts.
Use a restrained department identity accent color, but keep the app visually consistent with the Company Atlas.

Layout:
- Left/primary area: department command brief and management board.
- Top: department identity bar with health, owner focus, and AI readiness.
- Middle: subsystem tabs for overview, goals, workflows, tasks, records, knowledge, resources, metrics, risks, decisions, AI, improvements.
- Right rail: evidence graph with linked records, files, tasks, decisions, events, and audit.
- Bottom area: improvement loop with feedback, standards, and next gaps.

Content:
Use realistic labels for [DEPARTMENT_SYSTEM_NAME] only.
Do not use fake company names, fake huge metrics, stock photos, or decorative illustrations.
Text must be legible and not overlap.
Show empty or partial states honestly where data may be missing.

Generate desktop and mobile concepts separately if needed.
```

## Implementation Planning Prompt

```text
Plan the smallest safe V1 implementation slice for [DEPARTMENT_SYSTEM_NAME].

Use the current CompanyCore architecture and existing backend contracts.
Do not add schema, migrations, new providers, or raw CRUD unless the plan explicitly marks them as future work.

Output:
1. Current route and target route.
2. Existing data contracts to reuse.
3. Components to build or reuse.
4. Read-only scope for the first slice.
5. Safe write actions, only if existing endpoints support them.
6. Missing backend contracts.
7. MCP/Paperclip read packet for this department.
8. Validation plan:
   - build
   - API test or source proof
   - desktop render proof
   - mobile render proof
   - no horizontal overflow
   - no console errors
   - no unnamed visible controls
9. Documentation updates required.
10. Rollback or disable path.
```

## Agent Capability Prompt

```text
Define the Paperclip/AI agent operating packet for [DEPARTMENT_SYSTEM_NAME].

The packet must include:
- Department purpose.
- Current goals and constraints.
- Relevant tasks and blockers.
- Relevant tables/records.
- Relevant files and knowledge.
- Relevant processes/pipelines/stages.
- Metrics and risks.
- Decisions and standards.
- Allowed MCP tools.
- Disallowed actions.
- Approval-required actions.
- Evidence the agent must create when acting.
- Feedback loop after completion.

Classify every action as:
- read-only
- propose-only
- supervised write
- blocked until future contract

Do not allow direct database access, raw provider tokens, unapproved workflow activation, destructive writes, or acceptance without evidence.

## Batch Planning Prompt

Use this when generating a sequence of implementation tasks:

```text
Create a phased V1 build plan for all 13 CompanyCore Department Management Systems.

Use the department system inventory and prompt seeds.
For each department:
1. classify current state as implemented, partial, planned, or missing;
2. identify existing backend contracts to reuse;
3. define the first read-only UI slice;
4. define the first safe write action only if existing APIs support it;
5. define the Paperclip/AI read packet;
6. define validation evidence required;
7. define the next smallest task contract ID.

Prioritize:
1. Strategy
2. Sales
3. Work Execution
4. Knowledge
5. AI Agents
6. Product/Delivery
7. Relationships
8. Finance
9. Operations
10. Assets
11. Integrations
12. People/Roles
13. Main Orchestration

Do not start code. Produce planning rows only.
```
