# Deployment

## Local Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Services:

- `backend`: Node/Express API and owner console on port `3000`
- `postgres`: PostgreSQL available inside the Compose network

The backend startup command runs:

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate:deploy
npm run seed
node dist/server.js
```

Production startup must use `prisma migrate deploy`. Do not use
`prisma db push` against production.

The current seed command is for local/bootstrap use. For production, run seed
only when intentionally creating the first owner workspace and first workspace
API key, with `SEED_OWNER_EMAIL`, `SEED_OWNER_PASSWORD`,
`SEED_WORKSPACE_NAME`, and `SEED_API_KEY` explicitly set. After the first owner
exists, do not rerun seed as a standing production shortcut.

## Local Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate:dev
npm run dev
```

For local development without Docker, provide a reachable PostgreSQL
`DATABASE_URL`.

## Coolify

Use Docker Compose deployment with the repository root as the compose context
and `docker-compose.coolify.yml` as the compose file.

Public domains:

- Web domain: `https://companycore.luckysparrow.ch`
- API domain: `https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch`

Required environment values:

- `SERVICE_PASSWORD_POSTGRES`
- `SERVICE_PASSWORD_API_KEY`
- `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`
- `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` is recommended. If omitted, production falls back to
  `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` to preserve existing service API key hashes.
- `INTEGRATION_SECRET_KEY`
- `COMPANYCORE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` if the production browser allowlist differs
  from `https://companycore.luckysparrow.ch,https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch`

Production startup fails when required secrets are missing or still use the
committed development placeholder values.

Map domains to the `backend` service on container port `3000`.
The backend serves the owner console from `/` on the web domain. The
owner console calls the API domain for `/auth/*`, `/v1/*`, and compatibility
API aliases. The API domain root returns API metadata instead of the web UI.

Keep Postgres storage persistent through Coolify volume configuration.

Production deploys must use Prisma migrations. Do not use `prisma db push` for
production once data matters.

Migration release checklist:

- Review generated SQL before deploy.
- Test migration against an empty database.
- Test migration against a copy of the current foundation database when schema
  changes touch auth, workspaces, API keys, integrations, tasks, or external ID
  uniqueness.
- Confirm rollback or forward-fix plan before deploy.
- Back up the PostgreSQL volume/database before risky ownership or integration
  migrations.

## Smoke Check

```bash
curl https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/health
curl https://companycore.luckysparrow.ch/
curl https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/
curl -H "X-API-Key: <workspace-api-key>" https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/projects
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <owner-token>" https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/integration-settings/clickup
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <owner-token>" https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/tasks/sync/clickup/native
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <owner-token>" https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/events
```

Expected smoke evidence:

- `/health` returns healthy status.
- `https://companycore.luckysparrow.ch/` returns the owner console assets.
- `https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/` returns API metadata.
- Protected API rejects missing auth and accepts owner token or workspace API
  key.
- Owner console can log in, check a ClickUp token, select a ClickUp Workspace,
  select Lists, save settings, and trigger sync.
- ClickUp settings response redacts token material.
- Native ClickUp sync creates or updates tasks without duplicating records.
- `GET /events` shows `task_synced_from_clickup` and sync status events.
