## Mission Block
- Mission objective: Stop the Coolify restart loop caused by production config requiring a newly introduced `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET`.
- Release objective advanced: Restore production health while preserving existing service API key hashes.
- Included slices: config fallback, regression test, deployment docs, validation, commit and push.
- Explicit exclusions: rotating secrets, changing Coolify credentials, changing API key hashing algorithm.
- Checkpoint cadence: commit and push immediately after validation passes.
- Stop conditions: tests fail, fallback weakens placeholder rejection, or production remains unhealthy after deploy.
- Handoff expectation: production-compatible config and recorded validation evidence.

## Context
After the latest push, the production endpoint returned `503` and Coolify showed a restart loop. Local reproduction showed that production config fails when `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` is absent even when `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` and `INTEGRATION_SECRET_KEY` are present.

## Goal
Allow production to boot when `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` is omitted by falling back to the already required non-placeholder `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`, matching previous hash behavior and preserving existing service keys.

## Scope
- `src/config/env.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `docs/planning/prod-hotfix-001-task-contract.md`
- required source-of-truth state files after validation

## Implementation Plan
1. Reproduce the production env failure locally.
2. Change only `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` fallback semantics to use `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` when omitted.
3. Add a production config regression test for the compatibility fallback.
4. Update deployment docs to mark a separate hash secret as recommended, not mandatory.
5. Run build/test gates, commit, push, and verify public health after redeploy.

## Autonomous Loop Evidence

### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: Public web and API return `503`; production restart loop reported in Coolify.
- Gaps: Coolify may not have the newly required `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` because older production used `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` as the hash fallback.
- Inconsistencies: Docs said the new secret was mandatory, but production runtime had existing service keys likely derived from the old fallback.
- Architecture constraints: Do not rotate production secrets or invalidate existing agent keys during an emergency fix.

### 1a. Bootstrap Missing Project Knowledge
- Bootstrap needed: no
- Missing or template-like files: none
- Sources scanned: `src/config/env.ts`, `src/tests/api.test.ts`, deployment docs, public health endpoints.
- Rows created or corrected: pending verification update.
- Assumptions recorded: The restart loop is consistent with missing `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET`; public health confirms the app is unavailable.
- Blocking unknowns: Coolify logs were not required to reproduce this exact failure locally.
- Why it was safe to continue: The patch restores previous fallback behavior while keeping `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` required and placeholder-rejected.

### 2. Select One Priority Mission Objective
- Selected task: PROD-HOTFIX-001
- Priority rationale: Production is unavailable and restart-looping.
- Why other candidates were deferred: UX and maintainability work must wait until production health is restored.

### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: config, tests, deployment docs, task evidence.
- Logic: `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` uses `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` fallback in all environments unless explicitly configured.
- Edge cases: missing `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` still fails; placeholder `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` still fails; explicit `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` still works.

### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: Changed `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` to fall back to
  `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` when omitted, preserving previous service-key hash
  behavior while keeping production placeholder rejection.

### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: production config import check without
  `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET`; `git diff --check`; `npm run build`; `npm test`
  against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55466`.
- Result: Passed. `npm test` now has 5 passing tests, including the new
  production API key hash fallback regression.

### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: Set a new Coolify secret only.
- Technical debt introduced: no, because a separate hash secret remains recommended and supported.
- Scalability assessment: The fallback preserves compatibility while allowing future secret separation.
- Refinements made: Deployment docs now describe separate `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET`
  as recommended, with compatibility fallback when omitted.

### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: deployment docs and task contract in progress.
- Context updated: yes
- Learning journal updated: yes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Production env import passes when `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` and `INTEGRATION_SECRET_KEY` exist but `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` is omitted.
- [x] Missing or placeholder `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` still fails closed.
- [x] `npm test` passes.
- [x] Deployment docs describe the compatibility fallback.
- [ ] Public health recovers after push/deploy or remaining blocker is recorded.

## Success Signal
- User or operator problem: Coolify restart loop stops and public health returns a healthy response.
- Expected product or reliability outcome: Existing service API keys keep working because the previous hash secret source is preserved.
- How success will be observed: Public `/health` returns a successful response after redeploy.
- Post-launch learning needed: yes

## Deliverable For This Stage
Emergency production-compatible config hotfix with test and docs.

## Constraints
