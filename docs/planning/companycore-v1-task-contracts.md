# CompanyCore v1 Task Contracts

These task contracts turn the v1 audit into executable work. Each task must be
completed as its own small iteration and must update `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
`.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, and relevant docs when status changes.

## v1 Architecture Addendum: Workspace Ownership

CompanyCore v1 must include a workspace ownership boundary. Registration creates
an owner user and workspace atomically. Business data, API keys, integration
settings, and integration sync state must resolve to a workspace before writes
are accepted. This is not full enterprise multi-tenancy: no invitations,
billing, advanced RBAC, or organization admin UI are planned for v1.

## v1 Regression Guardrails

Every runtime task must preserve these rules:

- protected routes resolve `workspaceId`
- cross-workspace access fails closed
- integration secrets are not logged or returned
- external sync is idempotent per `(workspace_id, source, external_id)`
- schema changes use migrations
- significant state changes emit events
- API errors use stable, safe response codes
- tests include allowed and denied paths

## CCV1-018 Owner-Managed Adapter API Keys

### Header
- ID: CCV1-018
- Title: Owner-managed adapter API keys
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Security
- Depends on: CCV1-007, CCV1-006
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-018
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Add a safe owner-controlled API key management path so adapters such as Jarvan
and Aviary can be connected without GUI work, seed reruns, or direct database
access.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Owner can create a workspace service API key through `/v1/api-keys`.
- [x] New API keys are stored hashed and not stored as plaintext in the legacy
  `key` column.
- [x] Raw key is returned only once on creation.
- [x] List/update responses redact raw key material.
- [x] Service API keys cannot create more API keys.
- [x] Created key works with `X-API-Key`.
- [x] `npm test` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added owner-only service API key management for adapter
  onboarding, including generated `cc_v1_*` keys, hash-only storage for new
  keys, redacted list/update responses, activation toggling, and test coverage.
- Files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `prisma/migrations/202605027_api_key_management/migration.sql`,
  `prisma/seed.ts`, `src/auth/api-key.ts`, `src/app.ts`,
  `src/modules/api-keys/api-keys.routes.ts`, `src/tests/api.test.ts`,
  `docs/API.md`, `docs/DATABASE.md`, `docs/security/security-baseline.md`,
  `docs/engineering/testing.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Ran `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL at `localhost:55432`;
  the command applied all 7 migrations from scratch and passed endpoint tests.
- What is incomplete: A richer UI for key rotation remains out of v1 scope.
- Follow-up fix: After first production redeploy returned `503`, updated
  `prisma/seed.ts` to find an existing legacy plaintext seed API key before
  creating a hash-backed row, preventing duplicate key conflicts during
  transition deploys.
- Next steps: Push and let auto-deploy run, then rerun CCV1-009 production
  smoke.

## CCV1-021 Adapter Connection Handshake For Paperclip And Jarvis

### Header
- ID: CCV1-021
- Title: Adapter connection handshake for Paperclip and Jarvis
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-018, CCV1-019
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-021
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Context
Paperclip, Jarvis, Jarvan, Aviary, and similar adapters need a stable first API
call that proves their key works and tells them what CompanyCore can safely do
for the active workspace.

### Goal
Expose a safe connection handshake that returns API version, workspace identity,
auth type, capabilities, and non-secret integration readiness.

### Scope
- `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`
- `src/app.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`
- `.codex/context/*`

### Implementation Plan
1. Add a protected `/connection` route mounted at root and `/v1`.
2. Return only safe auth, workspace, capability, and integration metadata.
3. Add endpoint coverage using a workspace service API key.
4. Document adapter environment variables and first-call sequence.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `GET /v1/connection` works with `X-API-Key`.
- [x] Response contains service name, API version, workspace identity, auth
  type, capabilities, and ClickUp readiness.
- [x] Response does not include raw API keys or integration tokens.
- [x] Endpoint test covers service-key handshake.
- [x] Adapter onboarding docs explain Paperclip/Jarvis setup.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added a service-adapter handshake and onboarding doc so
  Paperclip/Jarvis-style clients can connect through CompanyCore safely.
- Files changed: `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`, `src/app.ts`,
  `src/tests/api.test.ts`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`,
  `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: `npm run build` and `npm test` against a disposable PostgreSQL
  database.
- What is incomplete: Production adapter smoke still needs an actual
  production workspace service API key.
- Next steps: Create/obtain Paperclip and Jarvis production API keys, store
  them in those apps, and call `/v1/connection`.

## CCV1-019 Database/API Workspace Coverage For Core Records

### Header
- ID: CCV1-019
- Title: Database/API workspace coverage for core records
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-012, CCV1-018
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-019
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with the workspace source-of-truth contract.

### Context
Owner auth and workspace-scoped API keys existed, but several business tables
and routes still behaved as global records. That could leak operational data
between workspaces once more owners or adapter keys exist.

### Goal
Make remaining core business records workspace-owned at the database and API
layers, and reject foreign relation IDs before creating dependent records.

### Scope
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `prisma/migrations/202605028_workspace_core_records/migration.sql`
- `prisma/seed.ts`
- protected route modules for projects, goals, targets, tasks, clients, deals,
  notes, decisions, agent logs, and events
- ClickUp sync event emission
- endpoint integration tests
- API/database/planning/context docs

### Implementation Plan
1. Add nullable `workspace_id` columns, indexes, and foreign keys for remaining
   core tables so existing production data is preserved.
2. Persist `workspaceId` from auth context on new protected records and events.
3. Filter protected list routes by active workspace.
4. Validate supplied relation IDs against the active workspace.
5. Expand integration tests for cross-workspace visibility and relation denial.
6. Update source-of-truth docs and context.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Core business tables have workspace ownership columns.
- [x] Protected reads for implemented routes filter by active workspace.
- [x] Protected writes persist `workspaceId` from auth context.
- [x] Foreign relation IDs from another workspace return `not_found`.
- [x] Events are workspace-scoped.
- [x] Fresh `prisma migrate deploy` succeeds.
- [x] Endpoint integration tests pass.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added workspace ownership for remaining core records and closed
  global-list leakage for implemented protected routes.
- Files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `prisma/migrations/202605028_workspace_core_records/migration.sql`,
  `prisma/seed.ts`, `src/modules/*`, `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.sync.ts`,
  `src/tests/api.test.ts`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/DATABASE.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` against a
  disposable fresh PostgreSQL database.
- What is incomplete: Protected production smoke still needs approved
  production owner/API-key credentials and ClickUp settings.
- Next steps: Complete CCV1-009P protected production smoke when credentials
  are available.

## CCV1-001 Canonical Architecture And Deployment Docs Alignment

### Header
- ID: CCV1-001
- Title: Canonical architecture and deployment docs alignment
- Task Type: research
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: Audit findings from 2026-05-02
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-001
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Make the canonical architecture and operations documents reflect the actual
CompanyCore v1 backend-only architecture.

### Scope
- `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- `docs/architecture/architecture-source-of-truth.md`
- `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Compare current short-form docs in `docs/*.md` with canonical architecture
   and operations docs.
2. Replace active template placeholders with CompanyCore-specific truth.
3. Keep the approved v1 boundary: no GUI, API as access layer, PostgreSQL as
   source of truth, native ClickUp adapter as the first integration pattern,
   and n8n as optional orchestration.
4. Record deployment topology, private Postgres, public API, and required
   secrets.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Canonical architecture docs no longer describe placeholder systems.
- [x] Docs clearly state that CompanyCore v1 has no GUI.
- [x] Docs clearly state the
  `ClickUp API -> CompanyCore adapter -> DB -> event` flow.
- [x] Deployment contract lists backend, Postgres, volume, health check, and
  required secrets.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Docs are updated in English.
- [x] No runtime code changes are included.
- [x] Planning and project state remain synchronized.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Replaced canonical architecture and deployment placeholders
  with CompanyCore-specific backend-only architecture, workspace ownership,
  native ClickUp adapter direction, tech stack, and Coolify deployment contract.
- Files changed: `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`,
  `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`,
  `docs/architecture/architecture-source-of-truth.md`,
  `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Searched canonical docs for old template placeholder language,
  reviewed docs for the required architecture statements, and ran
  `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Runtime implementation is unchanged; CCV1-011 must still
  finalize detailed workspace/auth schema and auth-context contract.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-011.

## CCV1-002 Real Planning Queue And Task Contracts

### Goal
Replace template planning placeholders with a real, dependency-aware
CompanyCore v1 execution queue.

### Scope
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/open-decisions.md`
- `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Convert audit findings into `NOW`, `NEXT`, and `PIPELINE` work.
2. Add task contracts for each planned v1 slice.
3. Record open decisions that block route, auth, and migration details.
4. Synchronize task board and project state.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] No placeholder `PRJ-001` planning rows remain in active planning files.
- [x] Every queued v1 task has title, description, files likely affected,
  acceptance criteria, and priority.
- [x] Open decisions are explicit and assigned to future tasks.
- [x] Current project state points to the next executable slice.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Planning docs are updated in English.
- [x] No runtime implementation is included.
- [x] `npm run build` is optional because this is docs-only; run it only if
  code is touched.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Replaced placeholder planning with the CCV1 execution queue,
  task contracts, open decisions, task board updates, and project-state handoff.
- Files changed: `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`,

- How tested: Searched active planning/context files for old placeholder task
  markers and reviewed the git diff. No runtime code changed.
- What is incomplete: Canonical architecture and operations docs still need
  CCV1-001.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-001.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] A baseline migration represents the current Prisma schema.
- [x] Workspace/auth/integration settings schema changes are represented by
  explicit migrations when those tasks are implemented.
- [x] Production startup no longer depends on uncontrolled `prisma db push`.
- [x] Local development still has a documented schema setup path.
- [x] Deployment docs describe migration command, rollback trigger, and backup

### Result Report
- Task summary: Started production verification and confirmed the public API
  health endpoint works. Verification is blocked because production is not yet
  serving the current v1 route build and production credentials were not
  available for protected smoke checks.
- Files changed: `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and this

  `https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/v1/projects`,
  `https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/projects`, and
  `https://companycore.luckysparrow.ch`.
- What is incomplete: owner/auth protected smoke, workspace API key smoke,
  ClickUp settings read/write, native ClickUp sync, and event readback require
  deploying the latest commits and providing production credentials.
- Next steps: Deploy current branch, then rerun CCV1-009 with owner token or
  workspace API key and configured ClickUp settings.

## CCV1-010 Native ClickUp Integration Contract And First Adapter Slice

### Header
- ID: CCV1-010
- Title: Native ClickUp integration contract and first adapter slice
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-001, DEC-005, CCV1-003, CCV1-013, CCV1-017
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-010
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Implement ClickUp as the first native CompanyCore integration adapter so Jarvis
and future AI agents can use CompanyCore directly without requiring separate
n8n workflows.

### Goal
Create the reusable integration pattern for external systems by adding a
minimal, production-shaped ClickUp adapter that can fetch ClickUp task data,
normalize it, persist it through existing CompanyCore models inside the active
workspace, and emit events.

### Scope
- `src/integrations/clickup/*`
- `src/modules/tasks/*`
- `src/modules/events/*`
- `src/config/env.ts`
- `prisma/schema.prisma` and migrations only if integration state tables are
  approved
- `.env.example`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`
- `docs/operations/service-reliability-and-observability.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Define the smallest approved v1 ClickUp scope from DEC-005 before coding.
2. Read ClickUp configuration from workspace integration settings, with only
   encryption/application secrets coming from environment variables.
3. Build a dedicated ClickUp client/adapter under `src/integrations/clickup`.
4. Normalize ClickUp tasks into the existing `Task` model with `source =
   clickup`, `externalId`, and the active `workspaceId`.
5. Reuse existing task upsert and event creation behavior where possible.
6. Add an authenticated endpoint or service command to trigger sync.
7. Record failure behavior, retry expectations, and observability notes.

### Files Likely Affected
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.client.ts`
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.mapper.ts`
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.sync.ts`
- `src/modules/tasks/tasks.routes.ts`
- `src/config/env.ts`
- workspace integration settings modules from CCV1-013
- `.env.example`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] CompanyCore can call the ClickUp API using workspace-owned credentials.
- [x] ClickUp tasks are normalized into CompanyCore tasks inside the active
  workspace.
- [x] Sync upserts by `(workspace_id, source = clickup, external_id)`.
- [x] Sync emits `task_synced_from_clickup`.
- [x] Integration failures return safe API errors and do not corrupt existing
  tasks.
- [x] ClickUp secrets are not logged, not returned by API responses, and are
  documented in integration/deployment docs.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Implemented the first native ClickUp pull-sync adapter with a
  provider client, mapper, sync service, protected trigger route, task
  workspace ownership, idempotent task upsert, and sync events.
- Files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma`,

  `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`,
  and this task contract.
- How tested: Reviewed official ClickUp API docs for task filtering, ran
  `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`, `npx prisma validate` with a local
  `DATABASE_URL`, and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Automated endpoint tests and real ClickUp production
  smoke remain in CCV1-006 and CCV1-009.
- Next steps: Continue with CCV1-004 event coverage or CCV1-007 API key
  hardening, depending on release-risk priority.

- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Implement owner registration and login so CompanyCore can create a workspace
automatically and authenticate future API or GUI clients.

### Goal
Provide the minimal auth runtime for v1: owner registration creates user and
workspace in one transaction; login returns an authenticated context; protected
business routes can resolve `userId` and `workspaceId`.

### Files Likely Affected

- `docs/DATABASE.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `POST /auth/register` or approved equivalent creates owner user and
  workspace atomically.
- [x] Duplicate email/owner registration is handled safely.
- [x] `POST /auth/login` or approved equivalent authenticates the owner.
- [x] Passwords or login secrets are hashed; plaintext credentials are never
  stored.
- [x] Protected routes can resolve `workspaceId`.
- [x] `GET /health` remains public.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Result Report

### Description
Add the storage and API contract for workspace-owned integration settings,
starting with ClickUp credentials and sync configuration.

### Goal
Store integration configuration under the workspace so ClickUp and future
integrations are not global process settings. Secrets must be protected,
non-leaking, and usable by native integration adapters.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Workspace can store ClickUp token/config through an authenticated route or
  approved bootstrap path.
- [x] Integration settings are tied to `workspaceId`.
- [x] Secret values are encrypted or otherwise protected according to the
  approved v1 security plan.
- [x] Secret values are never returned in API responses or logs.
- [x] Cross-workspace access is rejected.
- [x] ClickUp adapter contract reads settings through this workspace-scoped
  mechanism.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added workspace-owned integration settings, encrypted provider
  secret storage, ClickUp settings routes, and service helpers for native
  adapters to read decrypted workspace settings inside the backend process.

- How tested: Ran `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`,
  `npx prisma validate` with a local `DATABASE_URL`, and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Native ClickUp API calls and sync behavior remain in
  CCV1-010 after CCV1-017 defines the adapter observability contract.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-017 integration adapter contract and observability
  minimum, then implement CCV1-010 native ClickUp sync.
