# CompanyCore v1 Task Contracts

These task contracts turn the v1 audit into executable work. Each task must be
completed as its own small iteration and must update `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
`.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, and relevant docs when status changes.

## CCV1-067 Tech Stack Runtime Status Refresh

### Header
- ID: CCV1-067
- Title: Tech stack runtime status refresh
- Task Type: architecture documentation
- Current Stage: post-release
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: CCV1-066
- Priority: P2
- Iteration: v1-067
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Context
`docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` still described auth, tests, migrations,
owner console, and Google Drive as planned or future-only surfaces.

### Goal
Align the tech stack source-of-truth with the accepted runtime and documented
validation commands.

### Scope
- `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Review stale stack statements against current project state.
2. Update implemented auth, tests, migrations, owner console, scheduler, and
   Google Drive foundation language.
3. Keep true non-goals such as mobile app, billing, advanced RBAC, workflow
   engine, separate queue/worker tier, and Obsidian sync.
4. Validate formatting and targeted architecture-doc search.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: tech stack doc said tests were not configured and CCV1-006 still
  needed to add them.
- Gaps: owner console and Google Drive v2 foundation were described as future
  or minimal-only.
- Architecture constraints: do not introduce a new runtime stack.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-067.
- Priority rationale: architecture docs must not contradict accepted runtime.
- Why other candidates were deferred: remaining implementation work is blocked
  or decision-dependent.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: architecture documentation and queue metadata.
- Logic: update runtime status, not architecture direction.
- Edge cases: keep separate worker tier and mobile out of scope.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: refreshed tech stack wording.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `git diff --check`; targeted architecture-doc search.
- Result: passed.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: leave tech stack as early-v1 historical context.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: future stack changes have a cleaner baseline.
- Refinements made: distinguished backend in-process scheduler from separate
  worker infrastructure.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: tech stack, task board, project state, next commits, and this
  contract.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Tech stack doc records `npm test` instead of saying tests are missing.
- [x] Tech stack doc records implemented auth and migration deploy path.
- [x] Tech stack doc no longer treats Google Drive foundation as wholly future
  scope.

### Definition of Done
- [x] No runtime code changes are made.
- [x] Changes are documented in source-of-truth files.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: not applicable for docs-only architecture refresh.
- Manual checks: targeted architecture-doc search.
- High-risk checks: no secrets, deploy commands, migrations, or runtime files
  changed.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Refreshed tech stack docs to match accepted runtime status.
- Files changed: `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this file.
- How tested: `git diff --check` and targeted architecture-doc search.
- What is incomplete: no ready v1 task remains.
- Next steps: product/access decision.

## CCV1-066 Historical Guardrail Plan Classification

### Header
- ID: CCV1-066
- Title: Historical guardrail plan classification
- Task Type: release documentation
- Current Stage: post-release
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: CCV1-065
- Priority: P2
- Iteration: v1-066
- Operation Mode: ARCHITECT

### Context
The auth/workspace and regression-prevention planning docs still used
pre-stability language even though the corresponding CCV1 guardrail tasks were
delivered and v1 was accepted.

### Goal
Classify those planning docs as implemented historical guardrail plans so they
do not appear as active pre-v1 work.

### Scope
- `docs/planning/auth-workspace-integration-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/regression-prevention-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/planning-catalog-index.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Add status notes to both historical guardrail plans.
2. Rename pre-stability headings to completed/implemented language.
3. Add both files to the planning catalog index.
4. Validate formatting and targeted search results.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: `regression-prevention-plan.md` said fundamentals were missing before
  v1 could be called stable.
- Gaps: `auth-workspace-integration-plan.md` still presented delivered schema
  and implementation order as proposed.
- Architecture constraints: no runtime behavior changes.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-066.
- Priority rationale: stale guardrail docs can cause future agents to reopen
  completed foundational work.
- Why other candidates were deferred: active runtime work remains blocked or
  decision-dependent.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: planning docs and queue metadata only.
- Logic: classify, do not rewrite architecture.
- Edge cases: keep the invariant and done-state rules reusable.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added historical status notes and catalog rows.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `git diff --check`; targeted planning-source search.
- Result: passed.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: leaving these docs as archived context only.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: planning catalog now better separates historical
  guardrails from active queue.
- Refinements made: preserved guardrail content while changing active-status
  wording.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: auth/workspace plan, regression-prevention plan, planning
  catalog, task board, project state, next commits, and this contract.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Auth/workspace plan is clearly historical/implemented.
- [x] Regression-prevention plan no longer reads as missing pre-v1 work.
- [x] Planning catalog classifies both files.

### Definition of Done
- [x] No runtime code changes are made.
- [x] Changes are documented in source-of-truth files.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: not applicable for docs-only classification.
- Manual checks: targeted search for pre-v1-stability language.
- High-risk checks: no secrets, deploy commands, migrations, or runtime files
  changed.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Classified auth/workspace and regression-prevention plans as
  implemented historical guardrail docs.
- Files changed: `docs/planning/auth-workspace-integration-plan.md`,
  `docs/planning/regression-prevention-plan.md`,
  `docs/planning/planning-catalog-index.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and
  this file.
- How tested: `git diff --check` and targeted planning-source search.
- What is incomplete: no ready v1 task remains.
- Next steps: product/access decision.

## CCV1-065 Front-Door Docs Scope Refresh

### Header
- ID: CCV1-065
- Title: Front-door docs scope refresh
- Task Type: release documentation
- Current Stage: post-release
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: CCV1-064
- Priority: P2
- Iteration: v1-065
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Context
The top-level README, API, and deployment docs still described the owner
console as minimal/ClickUp-only and treated Google Drive/dashboarding as wholly
future scope, while later accepted work delivered owner-console modules, typed
business editors, and the Google Drive v2 server-side foundation.

### Goal
Align front-door documentation with the current accepted product surface
without changing runtime behavior.

### Scope
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Search front-door docs for stale minimal-console/backend-only language.
2. Update descriptions to name current owner-console and Google Drive v2
   foundation scope.
3. Keep blocked first real Drive import explicit.
4. Validate formatting and targeted search results.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: README/API/DEPLOYMENT described an older minimal owner console.
- Gaps: Google Drive v2 foundation was absent from front-door scope summary.
- Architecture constraints: API remains the supported integration layer.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-065.
- Priority rationale: entry docs should not contradict accepted v1/v2 evidence.
- Why other candidates were deferred: remaining runtime tasks are externally
  blocked or require a product decision.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: documentation only.
- Logic: update scope language, not contracts.
- Edge cases: keep owner consent/import blocked and do not claim mobile/full
  automation scope.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: refreshed README, API, and deployment descriptions.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `git diff --check`; targeted front-door docs search.
- Result: passed.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: leave front-door docs as historical.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: new contributors now see the current surface before
  diving into planning history.
- Refinements made: distinguished Google Drive foundation from real owner
  consent/import proof.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: front-door docs, task board, project state, next commits, and
  this contract.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] README names the current owner console and Google Drive v2 foundation.
- [x] API docs no longer describe the console as ClickUp-only.
- [x] Deployment docs describe the backend as serving the owner console, not a
  minimal setup-only page.

### Definition of Done
- [x] No runtime code changes are made.
- [x] Changes are documented in source-of-truth files.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: not applicable for docs-only front-door refresh.
- Manual checks: targeted search in README/API/DEPLOYMENT for stale scope
  language.
- High-risk checks: no secrets, deploy commands, migrations, or runtime files
  changed.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Refreshed front-door docs to match the current owner-console,
  typed editor, and Google Drive v2 foundation scope.
- Files changed: `docs/README.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this file.
- How tested: `git diff --check` and targeted front-door docs search.
- What is incomplete: no ready v1 task remains; first real Drive import remains
  blocked by owner OAuth consent.
- Next steps: product/access decision.

## CCV1-063 Historical Next Steps Refresh

### Header
- ID: CCV1-063
- Title: Historical next steps refresh
- Task Type: release documentation
- Current Stage: post-release
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: CCV1-062
- Priority: P2
- Iteration: v1-063
- Operation Mode: ARCHITECT

### Context
`docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` still described the early foundation state and instructed
future agents to start CCV1-001/CCV1-011, even though v1 runtime, agent
runtime hardening, and web-console polish are complete or externally blocked.

### Goal
Remove stale human-facing next-step guidance that could cause a future agent to
reopen completed v1 foundation work.

### Scope
- `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/planning-catalog-index.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Compare `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` against the current task board and project
   state.
2. Replace obsolete v1 foundation guidance with the current post-release
   boundary and blocked work.
3. Update the planning catalog so old planning files are classified correctly.
4. Validate formatting and source-of-truth consistency.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` claimed auth, workspace settings, tests, API key
  hardening, and ClickUp integration were still missing.
- Gaps: planning catalog still called AGRUN queued and only listed V2WEB
  through 021.
- Architecture constraints: no runtime behavior changes.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-063.
- Priority rationale: stale next-step docs can misdirect future autonomous work.
- Why other candidates were deferred: remaining real work is blocked by
  credentials/access or requires a product decision.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: documentation and queue metadata only.
- Logic: point readers to canonical queue files and name blocked work.
- Edge cases: do not create new product scope.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: rewrote `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` and refreshed planning
  catalog classifications.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `git diff --check`; source-of-truth review.
- Result: passed.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: deleting `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: future agents now have a human-readable summary that
  agrees with the canonical queue.
- Refinements made: marked Google Drive and agent source handoff as blocked
  rather than ready.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: next steps, planning catalog, task board, project state, next
  commits, and this contract.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` no longer instructs agents to start completed v1
  foundation tasks.
- [x] Planning catalog reflects current AGRUN, V2WEB, and V2GD status.
- [x] Canonical queue remains the task board, agent state, and next commits.

### Definition of Done
- [x] No runtime code changes are made.
- [x] Changes are documented in source-of-truth files.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: not applicable for docs-only next-step refresh.
- Manual checks: searched planning and operations files for stale open work
  signals and compared active queue files.
- High-risk checks: no secrets, deploy commands, migrations, or runtime files
  changed.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Replaced stale early-v1 `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` guidance with the
  current post-release boundary and blocked-work summary, and marked the
  original MVP execution plan as historical/implemented.
- Files changed: `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`,
  `docs/planning/planning-catalog-index.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and
  this file.
- How tested: `git diff --check` and source-of-truth review.
- What is incomplete: no ready v1 task remains; next work needs a product or
  access decision.
- Next steps: choose v2 scope, provide Google OAuth consent, provide upstream
  handoff access, or invest in deploy automation tooling.

## CCV1-064 Historical Checklist Closure

### Header
- ID: CCV1-064
- Title: Historical checklist closure
- Task Type: release documentation
- Current Stage: post-release
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: CCV1-063
- Priority: P2
- Iteration: v1-064
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Context
Historical planning documents still contained unchecked checklist items and a
blocked CCV1-009 contract even though later production smoke, AGCRUD rollout,
and v1 handoff evidence closed or superseded them.

### Goal
Remove false open-work signals from historical planning docs without changing
runtime behavior or hiding real external blockers.

### Scope
- `docs/planning/agent-crud-api-rollout-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Identify historical checklist rows that conflict with canonical done-state.
2. Mark AGCRUD planning checklist items complete because AGCRUD-001 through
   AGCRUD-006 are done.
3. Convert the old CCV1-009 blocked contract to done with a note that later
   production evidence superseded the original blocked state.
4. Validate formatting and source-of-truth consistency.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: AGCRUD planning task had `Status: DONE` but unchecked acceptance and
  done criteria.
- Gaps: old CCV1-009 contract remained `BLOCKED` even though later release
  readiness and operator handoff accepted v1 runtime.
- Architecture constraints: no runtime behavior changes.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-064.
- Priority rationale: unchecked historical checklist rows can misdirect future
  agents into reopening completed v1 work.
- Why other candidates were deferred: remaining real tasks are externally
  blocked or require product choice.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: documentation only.
- Logic: close only historical rows with later evidence.
- Edge cases: keep Google Drive owner consent and upstream source merge blocked.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: updated AGCRUD checklist rows and CCV1-009 result
  report/status.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `git diff --check`; targeted source-of-truth search.
- Result: passed.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: leave historical documents untouched.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: future planning-source cross-checks now produce fewer
  false positives.
- Refinements made: result reports now point to later accepted evidence instead
  of claiming new runtime work.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: AGCRUD plan, v1 task contracts, task board, project state, and
  next commits.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] AGCRUD planning checklist no longer appears incomplete.
- [x] Old CCV1-009 contract no longer appears as a live blocker.
- [x] External blockers remain blocked in canonical queue files.

### Definition of Done
- [x] No runtime code changes are made.
- [x] Changes are documented in source-of-truth files.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: not applicable for docs-only historical checklist closure.
- Manual checks: searched planning docs for stale unchecked CCV1/AGCRUD signals.
- High-risk checks: no secrets, deploy commands, migrations, or runtime files
  changed.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Closed stale historical checklist rows that contradicted later
  accepted v1 evidence.
- Files changed: `docs/planning/agent-crud-api-rollout-plan.md`,
  `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, and
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`.
- How tested: `git diff --check` and targeted planning-source search.
- What is incomplete: no ready v1 task remains.
- Next steps: product/access decision.

## CCV1-062 V1 Operator Runtime Pointer Refresh

### Header
- ID: CCV1-062
- Title: V1 operator runtime pointer refresh
- Task Type: release documentation
- Current Stage: post-release
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Ops/Release + Product Docs
- Depends on: CCV1-061, AGRUN-009
- Priority: P2
- Iteration: v1-062
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Context
The v1 handoff and rollback docs still referenced older runtime images after
the 2026-05-08 public health check reported build/image
`71f3eb3b063ea68226a1736c727c52882b33f27a`.

### Goal
Keep operator-facing v1 runtime and rollback pointers aligned with public
health evidence without inventing unverified VPS inventory.

### Scope
- `docs/operations/v1-operator-handoff.md`
- `docs/operations/rollback-and-recovery.md`
- `.agents/state/system-health.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Compare handoff and rollback pointers against the latest public health
   evidence.
2. Update operator docs to reference the current public build/image.
3. Preserve a clear warning that Docker/Coolify inventory must be refreshed
   from an approved operator shell before an actual rollback.
4. Validate docs formatting and source-of-truth consistency.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: operator handoff pointed at `bf59b2f`; rollback docs pointed at
  `7f0e090`; public health reported `71f3eb3`.
- Gaps: SSH inventory refresh failed in this session, so container names cannot
  be asserted as current.
- Architecture constraints: no runtime behavior changes.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-062.
- Priority rationale: stale rollback and runtime pointers are operational risk.
- Why other candidates were deferred: blocked external tasks still require
  credentials or write access.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: operations docs and state files only.
- Logic: document current public runtime signal and inventory limitation.
- Edge cases: do not claim a current Docker container name without SSH evidence.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: refreshed public runtime image/build references and
  rollback guidance.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `git diff --check`; source-of-truth review.
- Result: passed.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: leaving old pointers until SSH access is fixed.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: operators now have safer current evidence and know
  what must be refreshed before rollback.
- Refinements made: rollback doc explicitly distinguishes public health evidence
  from unverified container inventory.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: handoff, rollback, task board, project state, system health,
  this contract, and next commits.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Handoff doc references current public `/health` build/image.
- [x] Rollback doc no longer presents stale container inventory as current.
- [x] SSH inventory limitation is explicit.

### Definition of Done
- [x] No runtime code changes are made.
- [x] Changes are documented in source-of-truth files.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: not applicable for docs-only operations pointer refresh.
- Manual checks: compared v1 handoff and rollback docs against 2026-05-08
  public health evidence.
- High-risk checks: no secrets, deploy commands, migrations, or runtime files
  changed.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Refreshed v1 operator runtime and rollback docs to align with
  current public health build/image.
- Files changed: `docs/operations/v1-operator-handoff.md`,
  `docs/operations/rollback-and-recovery.md`, `.agents/state/system-health.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this file.
- How tested: `git diff --check` and source-of-truth review.
- What is incomplete: VPS Docker inventory still needs an approved operator
  shell before an actual rollback.
- Next steps: no ready v1 runtime task remains.

## CCV1-061 Agent State Source-Of-Truth Sync

### Header
- ID: CCV1-061
- Title: Agent state source-of-truth sync
- Task Type: release documentation
- Current Stage: post-release
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: CCV1-060
- Priority: P2
- Iteration: v1-061
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are planned.
- [x] No loop step is being skipped.
- [x] Exactly one priority task is selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the iteration number.
- [x] The task is aligned with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
CompanyCore v1 runtime is accepted, but `.agents/state/*` still contained
bootstrap placeholders. That made a continuation request ambiguous even though
`TASK_BOARD`, release readiness, and the operator handoff had enough evidence
to continue safely.

### Goal
Synchronize agent continuation state with the accepted v1 handoff and select
the next smallest executable task from the canonical queue.

### Scope
- `.agents/state/current-focus.md`
- `.agents/state/known-issues.md`
- `.agents/state/regression-log.md`
- `.agents/state/system-health.md`
- `.agents/state/next-steps.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Cross-check v1 handoff, release readiness, task board, and next commits.
2. Replace placeholder agent-state content with current v1 post-release truth.
3. Activate the next non-blocked task without changing runtime behavior.
4. Record validation and next-step evidence.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: `.agents/state/*` files had placeholders after v1 runtime closure.
- Gaps: `mvp-next-commits.md` had a historical auto-deploy success note while
  operations docs still classify auto-deploy as unresolved/manual rollover
  approved.
- Inconsistencies: `TASK_BOARD.md` had no ready task even though AGRUN-009 is a
  non-blocked evidence-reconciliation task.
- Architecture constraints: no runtime or architecture behavior should change.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-061 Agent State Source-Of-Truth Sync.
- Priority rationale: continuation state is the gateway for all future safe
  autonomous work.
- Why other candidates were deferred: AGRUN-007 and AGRUN-010 are externally
  blocked; AGRUN-008 should wait until release automation evidence is clean.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: documentation and agent-state files only.
- Logic: state v1 is accepted, keep external blockers explicit, make AGRUN-009
  the next ready analysis task.
- Edge cases: do not mark auto-deploy verified until operations evidence is
  reconciled.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: replaced placeholders, updated board/project state,
  and added this contract.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: source-of-truth cross-check and `git diff --check`.
- Result: passed.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: only updating `.agents/state/next-steps.md`.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: future agents can resume from repo state without
  hidden chat memory.
- Refinements made: captured the deploy-automation evidence drift as the next
  ready task instead of silently choosing feature work.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: task board, project state, next commits, agent state, and this
  task contract.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Agent state files no longer contain template placeholders.
- [x] The next executable task is visible in both `TASK_BOARD.md` and
  `.agents/state/next-steps.md`.
- [x] External blockers remain explicit and are not hidden as ready work.

### Definition of Done
- [x] No runtime code changes are made.
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] Behavior is reproducible from the evidence recorded below.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: not applicable for docs-only state sync.
- Manual checks: reviewed v1 handoff, release readiness, task board, next
  commits, and agent-state files.
- High-risk checks: no secrets, runtime routes, migrations, or deployment
  scripts changed.

### Integration Evidence
- `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` reviewed: yes.
- Real API/service path used: not applicable.
- Endpoint and client contract match: not applicable.
- DB schema and migrations verified: not applicable.
- Regression check performed: confirmed no runtime behavior changed and
  recorded state-placeholder drift in `.agents/state/regression-log.md`.

### Architecture Evidence
- Architecture source reviewed: `.agents/core/operating-system.md`,
  `.agents/core/execution-loop.md`, `docs/operations/v1-operator-handoff.md`,
  and `docs/operations/v1-release-readiness.md`.
- Fits approved architecture: yes.
- Mismatch discovered: no.
- Decision required from user: no.

### Deployment / Ops Evidence
- Deploy impact: none.
- Env or secret changes: none.
- Health-check impact: none.
- Rollback note: revert documentation-only changes if the state sync is wrong.
- `DEPLOYMENT_GATE.md` reviewed: not applicable.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Synced the agent continuation state to the accepted v1
  post-release boundary and activated AGRUN-009 as the next ready analysis
  task.
- Files changed: `.agents/state/current-focus.md`,
  `.agents/state/known-issues.md`, `.agents/state/regression-log.md`,
  `.agents/state/system-health.md`, `.agents/state/next-steps.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this file.
- How tested: source-of-truth review and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: deploy automation evidence still needs AGRUN-009.
- Next steps: Run AGRUN-009 before changing deployment guidance.
- Decisions made: treat auto-deploy as unresolved until operations evidence is
  reconciled.

## CCV1-060 V1 Operator Handoff

### Header
- ID: CCV1-060
- Title: V1 operator handoff
- Task Type: release handoff
- Current Stage: post-release
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Ops/Release + Product Docs
- Depends on: CCV1-059
- Priority: P2
- Iteration: v1-060
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Create a concise operator-facing acceptance handoff for the completed
CompanyCore v1 runtime.

### Scope
- Production endpoints.
- Accepted v1 runtime scope.
- Current runtime image/container.
- Latest smoke and data state.
- Rollback pointer.
- Residual non-runtime blockers.
- Next product decision options.
- Canonical docs index and planning/context files.

### Implementation Plan
- Consolidate evidence from release readiness, post-deploy smoke, rollback,
  and source handoff docs.
- Add a single operator handoff doc under `docs/operations/`.
- Link the handoff doc from the docs index and canonical project state.
- Mark the task complete in planning and task board.
- Run standard docs/build/test gates.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Handoff states v1 accepted runtime scope.
- [x] Handoff lists production endpoints and current runtime image/container.
- [x] Handoff lists latest smoke summary and clean data state.
- [x] Handoff lists rollback pointer and operator checks.
- [x] Handoff distinguishes residual non-runtime blockers from v1 runtime
  readiness.
- [x] Docs index and canonical queue are synchronized.

### Definition of Done
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.
- [x] `npm test` passes against local PostgreSQL.
- [x] CompanyCore public health smoke passes.
- [x] Task board, project state, planning queue, task contract, docs index, and
  operator handoff are updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added the final v1 operator handoff document so the accepted
  runtime can be operated without reconstructing evidence from the task log.
- Files changed: `docs/operations/v1-operator-handoff.md`, `docs/README.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: `git diff --check`; `npm run build`; `npm test`; CompanyCore
  public health smoke.
- What is incomplete: No v1 runtime work remains. Non-runtime items remain
  blocked or optional: GitHub-to-Coolify auto-deploy tooling and upstream
  source merge routes for OpenJarvis/Paperclip.
- Next steps: Choose the first v2 scope or provide the credentials/tooling for
  one of the non-runtime handoff blockers.

## CCV1-059 GitHub Auto-Deploy Capability Audit

### Header
- ID: CCV1-059
- Title: GitHub auto-deploy capability audit
- Task Type: release automation audit
- Current Stage: release
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Ops/Release
- Depends on: CCV1-058
- Priority: P2
- Iteration: v1-059
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Determine whether the remaining GitHub-to-Coolify auto-deploy blocker can be
resolved in the current tool/session context.

### Scope
- Local GitHub CLI availability.
- Available GitHub connector tool surface.
- GitHub repository visibility and permissions for `Wroblewski-Patryk/companycore`.
- Coolify service health.
- CompanyCore release docs and planning/context files.

### Implementation Plan
- Check local `gh` availability and auth state.
- Inspect the GitHub connector tools exposed in-session for repository webhook
  administration support.
- Verify the GitHub connector can see the CompanyCore repository and permission
  level.
- Verify Coolify and CompanyCore runtime containers are healthy.
- Record the blocker as tooling/permission bound when webhook administration is
  unavailable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Local `gh` availability is checked.
- [x] GitHub connector repository visibility for CompanyCore is checked.
- [x] GitHub connector webhook-administration capability is checked.
- [x] Coolify service health is checked.
- [x] Auto-deploy blocker classification is updated.
- [x] Manual deploy remains documented as the approved release path.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Capability evidence recorded.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.
- [x] `npm test` passes against local PostgreSQL.
- [x] Task board, project state, planning queue, task contract, release
  readiness, and deployment contract docs are updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Confirmed GitHub-to-Coolify auto-deploy cannot be completed in
  this session because webhook administration is not exposed by the available
  GitHub tools and the local GitHub CLI is unavailable.
- Files changed: `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`,
  `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`,
  `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`, and
  `docs/operations/v1-release-readiness.md`.
- How tested: `gh auth status` failed because `gh` is not installed; GitHub
  connector repository listing showed `Wroblewski-Patryk/companycore` with
  `admin=true`; available GitHub connector tools do not include repository
  webhook list/create/update/delete; VPS inspection confirmed Coolify and
  CompanyCore containers are healthy; `git diff --check`; `npm run build`;
  `npm test`.
- What is incomplete: Completing auto-deploy requires one of: a GitHub tool
  surface with repository webhook administration, an authenticated `gh` CLI or
  token with webhook scope, or an approved Coolify deploy-token workflow.
- Next steps: Provide webhook-management credentials/tooling or keep using the
  proven manual rollover path for v1.

- Cherry-pick only the CompanyCore connector hygiene change.
- Run targeted connector/context tests from the clean worktree.
- Push the validated change to a dedicated handoff branch instead of upstream
  `main`.
- If push is rejected, record it as a permissions blocker with validation
  evidence.
- Remove the temporary clean worktree after evidence is captured.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] OpenJarvis handoff change applies cleanly to current upstream
  `origin/main`.
- [x] Targeted OpenJarvis CompanyCore tests pass.
- [x] No direct push to `main` is attempted.

- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.
- [x] `npm test` passes against local PostgreSQL.
- [x] Task board, project state, planning queue, task contract, source handoff
  package, and release readiness docs are updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Validated the OpenJarvis CompanyCore connector source handoff
  on a clean current upstream base and proved upstream branch push is blocked
  by GitHub write permissions, not code readiness.
- Files changed: `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`,
  `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`,
  `docs/operations/v1-source-handoff-package.md`, and
  `docs/operations/v1-release-readiness.md`.
- How tested: Created a clean OpenJarvis worktree from current `origin/main`,
  cherry-picked the CompanyCore connector hygiene change, ran
  `..\OpenJarvis\.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests\connectors\test_companycore.py tests\server\test_companycore_context.py -q`
  with 6 tests passing, then attempted
  `git push origin codex/companycore-connector-v1:codex/companycore-connector-v1`,
  which failed with GitHub `403`.
- What is incomplete: OpenJarvis upstream merge execution requires write
  access to `open-jarvis/OpenJarvis` or an approved fork/PR route.
- Next steps: Obtain OpenJarvis repository write access, create an approved
  fork PR route, or replay the validated four-file change in the upstream
  OpenJarvis release flow.

  `origin/master`.
- Run Paperclip server typecheck.
- Run the CompanyCore adapter unit test.
- Push the validated commit to a dedicated handoff branch instead of upstream
  `master`.
- If push is rejected, record it as a permissions blocker with validation
  evidence and keep the managed patch as the durable handoff artifact.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Paperclip worktree is clean and ahead by one adapter commit.
- [x] Paperclip server typecheck passes.
- [x] Paperclip CompanyCore adapter test passes.
- [x] No direct push to `master` is attempted.
- [x] Branch push result is recorded.

- Priority: P1
- Iteration: v1-054
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Make production CompanyCore run the final v1 runtime commit after the clean
sync, release boundary, and source handoff work.

### Scope
- CompanyCore production backend image and container.
- Production public and protected smoke checks.
- ClickUp maintenance idempotency smoke.
- Canonical release docs and planning/context files.

### Implementation Plan
- Build a production Docker image from final v1 runtime commit `9116026`.
- Start the new backend container on the existing Coolify network using the
  current backend runtime environment and labels.
- Verify migrations, seed, scheduler startup, and direct container health.
- Stop the previous backend container only after the new container passes
  direct health.
- Run public web/API smoke, protected connection smoke, and ClickUp
  maintenance `inspect_only` smoke.
- Record release evidence and rollback notes.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Production backend image exists for `9116026`.
- [x] New backend starts with no pending migrations and scheduler enabled.
- [x] Previous backend is stopped after new backend health passes.
- [x] Production Postgres remains running and healthy.
- [x] Public `/health`, `/v1/health`, web root, and API metadata checks pass.
- [x] Protected `/v1/connection` returns `200`.
- [x] ClickUp maintenance `inspect_only` returns 219 items, 0 created,

- Priority: P2
- Iteration: v1-053
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Make the deployed OpenJarvis and Paperclip CompanyCore integration changes
reproducible from managed source repositories.

### Scope
- OpenJarvis CompanyCore connector hygiene commit metadata.
- Paperclip CompanyCore adapter commit metadata.
- Validation and production smoke commands for both external apps.
- CompanyCore docs index and canonical planning/context files.

### Implementation Plan
- Inspect the local OpenJarvis and Paperclip integration commits.
- Record affected files, runtime behavior, validation commands, and handoff
  rules.
- Keep upstream push/PR execution out of this task because both external
  repositories require explicit ownership decisions and OpenJarvis has
  unrelated local changes.
- Update CompanyCore docs index and canonical queue files.
- Run docs validation and CompanyCore build/test gate.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] OpenJarvis handoff records commit, files, behavior, validation, and
  source-merge rule.
- [x] Paperclip handoff records commit, files, behavior, validation, patch
  apply command, and source-merge rule.
- [x] Production smoke checklist exists for repeating the handoff validation.
- [x] No external repository is pushed from a dirty or ambiguous checkout.
- [x] CompanyCore canonical docs and planning queue are synchronized.

### Definition of Done
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.
- [x] `npm test` passes against local PostgreSQL.
- [x] Task board, project state, planning queue, docs index, and task contract
  are updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added a v1 source handoff package for OpenJarvis and Paperclip
  so the deployed CompanyCore integration behavior can be reproduced in managed
  upstream source flows.
- Files changed: `docs/operations/v1-source-handoff-package.md`,
  `docs/README.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and
  this task contract.
- How tested: `git diff --check`; `npm run build`; `npm test` with
  `DATABASE_URL` pointing at local PostgreSQL on `localhost:55432`.
- What is incomplete: OpenJarvis and Paperclip upstream merge execution remains
  optional and requires an explicit repository ownership decision.
- Next steps: Choose v2 scope, execute source merge handoff, or complete
  GitHub-to-Coolify auto-deploy administration when tooling is available.

- Priority: P1
- Iteration: v1-052
- Operation Mode: ARCHITECT

### Goal
Close the approved CompanyCore v1 runtime slice without hiding the remaining
external handoff and release automation work.

### Scope
- Release readiness verdict.
- Canonical task board and next-commits queue.
- Project state.
- Post-deploy smoke record.
- OpenJarvis and Paperclip source handoff notes.
- GitHub-to-Coolify auto-deploy blocker classification.

### Implementation Plan
- Review the current canonical queue and release readiness evidence after
  CCV1-051.
- Promote the runtime verdict from release candidate to v1 achieved for the
  approved scope.
- Record that GitHub auto-deploy remains blocked by missing callable webhook
  administration tooling in this session, despite repository admin visibility.
- Record OpenJarvis and Paperclip source handoff status without pushing
  unrelated upstream changes.
- Keep future v2/product expansion separate from v1 runtime completion.
- Run docs validation and a production public health smoke.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] v1 achieved scope is explicit and limited to the approved runtime slice.
- [x] Runtime readiness is separated from external auto-deploy administration.
- [x] OpenJarvis and Paperclip handoff status is documented.
- [x] No new runtime code is changed.
- [x] Canonical board, project state, planning queue, release readiness, and
  smoke docs are synchronized.

### Definition of Done
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.
- [x] `npm test` passes against local PostgreSQL.
- [x] Production public CompanyCore health smoke passes.

  handoff when those repositories are ready.

## CCV1-051 Clean Sync Data Hygiene

### Header
- ID: CCV1-051
- Title: Clean sync data hygiene
- Task Type: runtime hardening
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder + QA/Test + Ops/Release
- Depends on: CCV1-050
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-051
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Keep CompanyCore and Jarvis clean after repeated ClickUp and CompanyCore
connector syncs.

### Scope
- ClickUp task sync event emission.
- OpenJarvis CompanyCore connector event indexing behavior.
- Production cleanup of smoke/test records and redundant sync events.
- Jarvis CompanyCore knowledge index rebuild.

### Implementation Plan
- Audit production CompanyCore and Jarvis storage for duplicated records and
  sync noise.
- Verify ClickUp task records are idempotent by external ID.
- Change ClickUp sync so unchanged task pulls are skipped and do not emit
  duplicate `task_synced_from_clickup` events.
- Change Jarvis CompanyCore connector so event indexing is opt-in through
  `COMPANYCORE_SYNC_EVENTS`.
- Back up production CompanyCore and Jarvis stores.
- Remove smoke/test records and redundant ClickUp sync events from production.
- Clear and rebuild Jarvis CompanyCore knowledge chunks from clean business
  records.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Production audit confirms no duplicate ClickUp tasks by external ID.
- [x] Repeated unchanged ClickUp pull does not emit another task sync event.
- [x] Jarvis CompanyCore connector does not index CompanyCore events by
  default.
- [x] Production backups exist before cleanup.
- [x] Production cleanup preserves real ClickUp task records.
- [x] Jarvis CompanyCore index is rebuilt from clean records.

### Definition of Done
- [x] CompanyCore tests pass.
- [x] OpenJarvis CompanyCore connector tests pass.
- [x] Production smoke verifies CompanyCore health and Jarvis connector health.
- [x] Task board, project state, planning queue, and task contract updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Hardened sync idempotency and cleaned production data noise
  caused by repeated ClickUp sync events and smoke records.
- Files changed in CompanyCore: `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.sync.ts`,
  `src/tests/api.test.ts`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this
  task contract.
- Files changed outside CompanyCore: OpenJarvis
  `src/openjarvis/connectors/companycore.py` and
  `tests/connectors/test_companycore.py`.
- How tested: CompanyCore `npm test`; OpenJarvis targeted CompanyCore tests;
  production SQL audit; production maintenance merge smoke showed 219
  unchanged items skipped and no new `task_synced_from_clickup` events;
  production Jarvis connector smoke rebuilt 259 CompanyCore chunks.
- What is incomplete: GitHub-to-Coolify auto-deploy webhook administration
  remains blocked by repository settings access.
- Next steps: Continue with v2 scope decisions or auto-deploy administration
  when credentials are available.

## CCV1-050 Jarvis CompanyCore Answer Precision Hardening

### Header
- ID: CCV1-050
- Title: Jarvis CompanyCore answer precision hardening
- Task Type: AI integration hardening
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: QA/Test + Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-049
- Priority: P1
- Iteration: v1-050
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Make Jarvis prefer durable CompanyCore business records over adapter smoke
records when a normal business prompt matches both.

### Scope
- OpenJarvis CompanyCore chat context injector.
- Production Jarvis deploy.
- CompanyCore smoke evidence and planning/context docs.

### Implementation Plan
- Reproduce the ambiguity in production chat smoke.
- Filter smoke/test records from CompanyCore chat context unless the prompt
  explicitly asks for smoke, test, or env records.
- Keep the connector sync path unchanged so smoke records remain available in
  the database and index.
- Run targeted OpenJarvis tests.
- Redeploy Jarvis and rerun the authenticated chat smoke.
- Update CompanyCore release readiness and smoke docs.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Ordinary CompanyCore business prompts exclude adapter smoke records from
  injected chat context.
- [x] Smoke/test prompts can still include smoke records.
- [x] Production Jarvis still reports `companycore.connected=true`.
- [x] The Paperclip onboarding chat smoke includes the durable project, two
  durable tasks, and `Jarvis production chat adapter`.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Targeted OpenJarvis tests pass.
- [x] Production Jarvis rebuild succeeds.
- [x] Authenticated connector and chat smokes pass.
- [x] CompanyCore task board, planning, project state, release readiness, and
  smoke docs are updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Reduced CompanyCore chat ambiguity by excluding adapter
  smoke/test records from ordinary Jarvis business prompts.
- Files changed outside CompanyCore: OpenJarvis
  `src/openjarvis/server/companycore_context.py` and
  `tests/server/test_companycore_context.py`.
- Files changed in CompanyCore: `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`,
  `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`,
  `docs/operations/jarvis-companycore-update-runbook.md`,
  `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md`, and
  `docs/operations/v1-release-readiness.md`.
- How tested: OpenJarvis targeted tests returned `5 passed`; production Jarvis
  connector returned `200`, `connected=true`, `auth_type=bridge`; production
  chat returned the Paperclip onboarding project, durable tasks, and
  `Jarvis production chat adapter`.
- What is incomplete: Nothing for this precision slice.
- Next steps: No active P0/P1 v1 runtime task remains ready.

## CCV1-049 Authenticated Jarvis Smoke And Managed Paperclip Source Path

### Header
- ID: CCV1-049
- Title: Authenticated Jarvis smoke and managed Paperclip source path
- Task Type: release hardening
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: QA/Test + Ops/Release
- Depends on: CCV1-048
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-049
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Close the two v1 hardening gaps left by the release audit: prove the protected
Jarvis CompanyCore connector path with real production auth and make the
Paperclip adapter patch durable outside the one-off production image patch.

### Scope
- Production Jarvis connector and chat smoke.
- OpenJarvis CompanyCore context relevance improvement.
- Paperclip adapter patch generated from the local Paperclip source commit.
- CompanyCore operations, planning, and context docs.

### Implementation Plan
- Run an authenticated production Jarvis connector smoke using protected
  Jarvis API access without exposing secrets.
- Trigger the CompanyCore connector sync and verify indexed chunks.
- Run a CompanyCore chat smoke and improve context ordering when production
  answers mix durable records with smoke records.
- Generate and store the Paperclip adapter patch in CompanyCore.
- Add a Paperclip adapter runbook with apply, validation, smoke, and rollback
  steps.
- Update release readiness, task board, project state, docs index, and queue.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Protected Jarvis connector endpoint returns `200`.
- [x] Jarvis reports `companycore.connected=true` and `auth_type=bridge`.
- [x] Jarvis CompanyCore sync can be triggered in production.
- [x] Jarvis chat answers from CompanyCore records after the context relevance
  improvement.
- [x] Paperclip adapter patch is stored in a managed CompanyCore path.
- [x] Paperclip adapter runbook documents apply, validation, production smoke,
  and rollback.

### Definition of Done
- [x] OpenJarvis targeted CompanyCore tests pass locally.
- [x] Production Jarvis rebuild succeeds.
- [x] Production Jarvis authenticated connector smoke passes.
- [x] Production Jarvis chat smoke confirms CompanyCore-backed answers.
- [x] Release readiness and canonical queue docs are updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Hardened the production Jarvis CompanyCore smoke and created a
  durable managed patch/runbook path for the Paperclip CompanyCore adapter.
- Files changed in CompanyCore: `integrations/paperclip/companycore-adapter.patch`,
  `docs/operations/paperclip-companycore-adapter-runbook.md`,
  `docs/operations/v1-release-readiness.md`, `docs/README.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- Files changed outside CompanyCore: OpenJarvis
  `src/openjarvis/server/companycore_context.py` and
  `tests/server/test_companycore_context.py`.
- How tested: OpenJarvis targeted tests returned `5 passed`; production Jarvis
  connector returned `200`, `connected=true`, `auth_type=bridge`; sync returned
  `status=started`; chat answered from CompanyCore project, decision, and task
  records.
- What is incomplete: Jarvis answer precision remains a P1 follow-up because a
  broad Paperclip prompt can still choose a smoke agent when multiple agent
  records match.
- Next steps: Harden Jarvis CompanyCore answer precision and merge the
  Paperclip adapter patch into the managed Paperclip application repository.

## CCV1-048 V1 Closure Audit

### Header

  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Production smoke for CompanyCore health, service-key connection,
  ClickUp maintenance inspect, scheduler log, Paperclip health, Paperclip
  issue origin rows, and CompanyCore pending Paperclip events.
- What is incomplete: Authenticated Jarvis public connector smoke and managed
  Paperclip adapter source/deploy path remain as hardening follow-up tasks.
- Next steps: Run authenticated Jarvis connector smoke and make the Paperclip
  adapter patch durable in the managed Paperclip deployment source.

## CCV1-047 Paperclip Application-Side CompanyCore Adapter

### Header
- ID: CCV1-047
- Title: Paperclip application-side CompanyCore adapter
- Task Type: integration
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-036E, CCV1-046
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-047
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Make Paperclip consume CompanyCore as the operational source of truth instead
of relying on direct provider paths or manual checks.

### Scope
- Production Paperclip application runtime.
- CompanyCore agent event API:
  `GET /v1/agent-events?targetAgent=paperclip` and
  `POST /v1/agent-events/:id/ack`.
- CompanyCore planning and context docs.

### Implementation Plan
- Add a Paperclip-side adapter service that starts only when
  `COMPANYCORE_BASE_URL` and `COMPANYCORE_API_KEY` are configured.
- Poll CompanyCore pending agent events for `targetAgent=paperclip`.
- Create idempotent Paperclip issues using `origin_kind =
  companycore_agent_event` and the CompanyCore agent event ID as `origin_id`.
- Ack CompanyCore events only after the local Paperclip issue is created or
  found already present.
- Deploy without upgrading unrelated Paperclip upstream code.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Paperclip starts with CompanyCore adapter enabled in production.
- [x] Adapter does not log API key material.
- [x] Pending CompanyCore agent event creates a Paperclip issue.
- [x] Repeated processing is idempotent by origin kind and origin ID.
- [x] Processed event is acknowledged through CompanyCore.
- [x] Paperclip health remains green after deployment.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Adapter mapping unit test passes in the Paperclip source checkout.
- [x] Paperclip server typecheck passes in the Paperclip source checkout.
- [x] Production Paperclip image builds from the current production source plus
  the adapter patch.
- [x] Production smoke proves issue creation and CompanyCore ack.
- [x] Task board, next-commits queue, project state, and task contract updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Deployed Paperclip's CompanyCore adapter so Paperclip consumes
  CompanyCore agent events and creates local idempotent work items.
- Files changed outside CompanyCore: Paperclip runtime files
  `server/src/services/companycore-adapter.ts` and `server/src/index.ts`.
- Files changed in CompanyCore: `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this
  task contract.
- How tested: Paperclip adapter unit test passed, Paperclip server typecheck
  passed, production image build passed, `/api/health` returned `200`, Paperclip
  created issue `LUC-37`, and CompanyCore returned 0 pending Paperclip events
  after ack.
- What is incomplete: v1 closure audit remains to verify the full release
  surface and any non-P0 residual gaps.
- Next steps: Run the v1 closure audit and update release readiness docs.

## CCV1-046 ClickUp Maintenance Scheduler

### Header
- ID: CCV1-046
- Title: ClickUp maintenance scheduler

- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-045
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-046
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Keep ClickUp-backed workspaces fresh without requiring a human or external
automation to call the maintenance endpoint.

### Scope
- `src/config/env.ts`
- `src/server.ts`
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.maintenance-scheduler.ts`
- `.env.example`
- architecture, API, planning, and context docs

### Implementation Plan
- Add scheduler configuration for the maintenance cadence and public API base
  URL requirement.
- Reuse the canonical ClickUp maintenance service for every active workspace
  ClickUp setting.
- Prevent overlapping sweeps and keep the scheduled import mode
  non-destructive.
- Start the scheduler only from the runtime server entrypoint so test app
  construction does not spawn background intervals.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Backend startup starts scheduled ClickUp maintenance when configured.
- [x] Scheduler skips startup safely when public API URL is missing or cadence
  is disabled.
- [x] Scheduler reuses the CCV1-045 maintenance path instead of duplicating
  webhook reconciliation, event replay, or sync logic.
- [x] Scheduled maintenance always uses `merge`.
- [x] Scheduler prevents overlapping sweeps.
- [x] API and architecture docs describe the scheduled freshness behavior.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Existing maintenance endpoint tests still pass.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.
- [x] `npm test` passes against local PostgreSQL.
- [x] Task board, next-commits queue, project state, and task contract updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added an in-process ClickUp maintenance scheduler that runs the
  non-destructive maintenance flow for active workspace ClickUp settings.
- Files changed: `src/config/env.ts`, `src/server.ts`,
  `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.maintenance-scheduler.ts`, `.env.example`,
  `docs/API.md`, `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Ran `npm run build` and `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointing
  at local PostgreSQL on `localhost:55432`. Production smoke verified public
  `/health`, `/v1/health`, Jarvis-key `/v1/connection`, and maintenance
  `inspect_only`.
- What is incomplete: Nothing for this scheduler slice.
- Next steps: Implement the Paperclip application-side adapter so it consumes
  CompanyCore agent events and writes through CompanyCore APIs.

### Release Evidence
- Commit deployed:
  `419dbafb11f1558a185ddd428e67073c3a89f0f6`.
- Production image:
  `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:419dbafb11f1558a185ddd428e67073c3a89f0f6`.
- Startup log: `clickup maintenance scheduler enabled every 15 minutes`.
- Maintenance smoke: 21 webhook registrations refreshed, 219 ClickUp tasks
  inspected, and 0 failed provider inbox rows remained.

  available for signature verification.
- Add HMAC SHA-256 signing/verification helpers matching official ClickUp
  webhook signature behavior.
- Prove the route fails closed until the full receiver is enabled.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Schema has workspace-scoped webhook registration, inbox, and outbox
  tables.
- [x] ClickUp webhook route receives raw JSON bodies outside protected API key
  middleware.
- [x] Missing signatures fail closed.
- [x] HMAC SHA-256 helper verifies valid signatures and rejects invalid ones.
- [x] Full event processing remains disabled until CCV1-036B/C provide stored
  webhook secrets and inbox writes.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Official ClickUp webhook docs reviewed for user-token ownership, raw-body
  HMAC signature verification, event payloads, and idempotency.
- [x] Fresh migration path validated.
- [x] Regression tests pass.
- [x] Task board, next-commits queue, project state, and task contract updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added the database and route/security foundation for ClickUp
  live sync.
- Files changed: Prisma schema and migration, app route mount, HMAC helper,
  webhook route, API test, and planning/context docs.
- How tested: `npm run build`; `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointing at

- Add agent event read/ack APIs.
- Write supported CompanyCore edits for ClickUp-sourced tasks back to ClickUp.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Webhooks can be reconciled from saved ClickUp settings.
- [x] Returned ClickUp webhook secrets are encrypted and never returned.
- [x] Signed task webhook events update CompanyCore task records.
- [x] Duplicate webhook deliveries are idempotent.
- [x] Status changes create agent-readable outbox events.
- [x] Agents can list and ack pending events.
- [x] CompanyCore task edits for ClickUp-sourced tasks call ClickUp update API.

  agent event fan-out, and CompanyCore-to-ClickUp write-back.
- Files changed: ClickUp client/service, webhook route, integration settings
  route, agent event route, task write-back path, app mount, tests, and docs.
- How tested: `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at disposable PostgreSQL
  on `localhost:55432`.
- What is incomplete: production webhook reconciliation and real ClickUp status
  smoke are intentionally left for CCV1-036F after deploy.

### Goal
Prove the deployed production bridge works in both directions with real ClickUp
data and no lasting task pollution.

### Scope
- Production CompanyCore deployment
- ClickUp webhook registrations
- Provider inbox and agent outbox readback
- `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md`
- planning/context docs

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Unsigned webhook requests fail closed.
- [x] A signed webhook updates/reads through the deployed receiver.
- [x] A real CompanyCore task update writes to ClickUp.
- [x] ClickUp sends natural signed webhook events back to CompanyCore.
- [x] Provider inbox rows are processed and signature-verified.
- [x] The touched task is restored to its original title.

### Validation Evidence
- Deploy: Coolify manual deploy `e12x9rc7i8071qfnrzh6u1hh`.
- Runtime image:
  `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:75df028f9dc3cab59f026fd7d2c5fef430e6d5ea`.
- Public health: `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/health`
  returned `200`.
- Webhooks: `21` active ClickUp List webhooks registered.
- Signed smoke: `POST /v1/webhooks/clickup` returned `202 accepted`.
- Natural roundtrip: changing ClickUp task `86c5fqumu` through CompanyCore
  produced `2` natural ClickUp `taskUpdated` inbox rows, both
  `processingStatus = processed` and `signatureVerified = true`.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Completed the production webhook and write-back smoke.
- Files changed: operations smoke evidence, project state, task board, and
  next-commits queue.
- How tested: deployed runtime checks plus real ClickUp roundtrip smoke.
- What is incomplete: Paperclip still needs application-side consumption of
  CompanyCore agent events.

### Goal
Allow adapters and owner clients to register workspace/folder/table-scoped
storage locations and knowledge roots.

### Scope
- `src/modules/operating-model/operating-model.routes.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Storage locations can be created with workspace-derived ownership.
- [x] Knowledge roots can be created with workspace-derived ownership.
- [x] Optional `areaId`, `folderId`, and `tableId` are validated in the active
  workspace.
- [x] Foreign scope IDs fail closed with `not_found`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm test` creates Google Drive-style storage and Obsidian-style
  knowledge roots for the `goals` table and rejects a foreign workspace write.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added scoped storage and knowledge root APIs.
- Files changed: operating model route, tests, API/database docs, and context.
- How tested: build plus `npm test`.
- What is incomplete: syncing file contents remains out of scope.

### Goal
Register automations against workspace, area, folder, or table scopes so
scheduled syncs, webhooks, and external orchestrators can be tracked
consistently.

### Scope
- `src/modules/operating-model/operating-model.routes.ts`

- `docs/API.md`
- planning/context docs

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Automation definitions can be created through the API.
- [x] Automation scope IDs are validated inside the active workspace.
- [x] Definitions store provider, trigger type, enabled state, and config.
- [x] Continuous ClickUp scheduled/webhook behavior remains a separate
  implementation decision.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm test` creates a ClickUp `scheduled_pull` automation definition
  scoped to the `goals` table.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added the automation definition API and scope validation.
- Files changed: operating model route, tests, API docs, planning queue, task
  board, and project state.
- How tested: build plus `npm test`.
- What is incomplete: automation execution/webhook receiver is not active yet.

- [x] First-party API tables are registered under stable areas.
- [x] `goals` and `targets` are assigned to Strategy and governance.
- [x] System tables remain outside the 12-area business table catalog.
- [x] Existing workspaces are backfilled by migration.
- [x] New registrations and seed/bootstrap create the registry.
- [x] `/v1/connection` exposes safe operating model metadata.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://companycore:companycore@localhost:55432/companycore_test?schema=public`.
- Prisma: `npx prisma generate`; `npx prisma validate` with `DATABASE_URL`
  set.
- Migration: fresh disposable PostgreSQL applied all migrations including
  `202605031_operating_model_registry`; second `npm test` run confirmed no
  pending migrations.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added the operating model registry and wired it into workspace
  bootstrap and connection metadata.
- Files changed: Prisma schema/migration, operating model service, auth
  registration, seed, connection route, tests, docs, task board, project state,
  and next commits.
- How tested: build, Prisma validation/generation, fresh migration deploy, and

- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Close the remaining ClickUp bidirectional API gaps so CompanyCore can act as
the source-of-truth API while preserving 1:1 mapping to selected ClickUp Lists,
Tasks, Custom Fields, and webhook registrations.

### Goal
Support full v1 task bridge operations through CompanyCore: create ClickUp
tasks from mapped lists, write task updates, archive tasks, write mapped Custom
Fields, and manage ClickUp webhook registrations with health reconciliation.

### Scope
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.client.ts`
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.webhooks.ts`
- `src/modules/tasks/tasks.routes.ts`
- `src/modules/integration-settings/integration-settings.routes.ts`

- `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`

### Implementation Plan
- Extend the ClickUp client with Create Task, Set Custom Field Value, Delete
  Webhook, archived task update support, and empty-body response handling.
- Route CompanyCore task creation through ClickUp first when the target task
  list is ClickUp-sourced.
- Add task archival and mapped Custom Field write endpoints.
- Improve webhook reconciliation to compare local records with ClickUp remote
  webhooks, refresh health, reactivate inactive hooks, replace missing remote
  registrations, and allow owner deletion.
- Update adapter manifest, API docs, architecture truth, planning, and tests.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Creating a task under a ClickUp-sourced list calls ClickUp Create Task
  before local persistence and stores the returned external ID.
- [x] Updating a ClickUp-sourced task still writes supported fields back to
  ClickUp before local update.
- [x] Deleting a ClickUp-sourced task archives it in ClickUp before local
  archival.
- [x] Mapped ClickUp Custom Field values can be written through a protected
  CompanyCore route.
- [x] Webhook reconciliation refreshes health against ClickUp remote state and
  owner users can delete registrations.
- [x] Adapter manifest and API docs expose the new capabilities safely.
- [x] Local integration tests pass.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Implementation uses existing workspace-scoped settings and encrypted
  provider secrets.
- [x] No raw ClickUp tokens or webhook secrets are returned to clients.
- [x] Provider errors map to safe API error codes.
- [x] Runtime routes emit events for success and provider failure paths.
- [x] `npm test` passes against disposable PostgreSQL.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added ClickUp task creation, archival, Custom Field write, and
  webhook delete/health reconciliation capabilities to the existing native
  ClickUp bridge.
- Files changed: ClickUp client/service files, task and integration routes,
  connection manifest, API/architecture/planning/context docs, and regression
  tests.
- How tested: Ran `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at disposable
  PostgreSQL on `localhost:55432`; the test suite performed build, migrate
  deploy, and API flow checks.
- What is incomplete: No known incomplete item in the CompanyCore-side ClickUp
  API bridge slice.
- Next steps: Continue the Paperclip application-side adapter so it consumes
  CompanyCore agent events and writes through CompanyCore.

- Expose safe ClickUp inbox metadata through protected API.
- Add owner-only failed-event replay using the same idempotent processor as
  live webhook ingestion.
- Add regression coverage for failed event listing and successful retry.
- Update architecture, API, planning, and context docs.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Failed ClickUp webhook processing records a stable last error code.
- [x] Protected API can list safe ClickUp provider event metadata by status.
- [x] Owner users can replay failed ClickUp provider events without raw DB
  access.
- [x] Successful replay updates CompanyCore data and clears `lastErrorCode`.
- [x] Local integration tests pass with the new migration.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Raw webhook payloads are not returned by health/list endpoints.
- [x] Retry uses the existing idempotent mapper and workspace scope.
- [x] Service clients can read inbox health; retry remains owner-only.
- [x] `npm test` passes against disposable PostgreSQL.

### Description
Add the canonical non-destructive maintenance operation that keeps CompanyCore
fresh when webhooks are delayed, missed, or partially failed.

### Goal
Provide one authenticated API command that reconciles ClickUp webhook health,
retries failed provider events, and performs a safe pull fallback from ClickUp.

### Scope

- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`

### Implementation Plan
- Add a ClickUp maintenance service that runs webhook reconciliation,
  failed-event retry, and native task sync.
- Expose `POST /v1/integration-settings/clickup/maintenance/run`.
- Allow non-destructive modes only: `merge`, `skip_existing`, `inspect_only`.
- Add adapter manifest capability for maintenance.
- Cover service-key invocation in integration tests.
- Update API and architecture source of truth.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Maintenance run reconciles selected-list webhooks.
- [x] Maintenance run retries failed ClickUp provider events.
- [x] Maintenance run performs a non-destructive pull fallback from ClickUp.
- [x] Service API keys can invoke the maintenance endpoint.
- [x] Destructive `replace_selected_lists` is not accepted by maintenance.
- [x] Local integration tests pass.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Maintenance uses workspace-scoped ClickUp settings and encrypted token
  reads.
- [x] Maintenance emits an observable completion event.
- [x] Maintenance returns webhook, retry, sync, and inbox-health summary data.
- [x] API and architecture docs describe the freshness role.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added ClickUp maintenance run for always-fresh fallback sync.
- Files changed: ClickUp service, integration settings route, connection
  manifest, regression tests, architecture/API/planning/context docs.
- How tested: Ran `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at disposable
  PostgreSQL on `localhost:55432`.
- What is incomplete: No known incomplete item in the CompanyCore-side ClickUp
  maintenance freshness run slice.
- Next steps: Continue application-side Paperclip/Jarvis scheduling or adapter
  consumption so maintenance can be invoked on a cadence by the surrounding

- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Before the owner enters a real ClickUp API token, make the first-run import
behavior explicit and testable so CompanyCore can safely decide what happens
when task records already exist.

### Goal
Provide an end-to-end ClickUp launch path where token setup, selected Lists,
task priority/list mapping, import policy, production bootstrap, Jarvis-facing
data availability, and regression tests are aligned.

### Scope

- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Audit the existing ClickUp sync path from saved token/config through native
   sync and Jarvis-readable CompanyCore tables.
2. Add explicit import modes for merge, skip-existing, replace-selected-lists,
   and inspect-only.
3. Wire the import mode through settings validation, native sync request body,
   owner console, production bootstrap script, and safe sync response counts.
4. Add regression tests for priority/list mapping and all existing-record
   policies, including proof that replace-selected-lists preserves native
   CompanyCore tasks.
5. Update architecture, API, integration, operations, task board, project
   state, and planning docs.
6. Run local quality gates and commit the final scoped change.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Owner setup can save a ClickUp token, team/list IDs, and import mode.
- [x] Native sync defaults to `merge` and can be overridden per run.
- [x] `merge` updates existing ClickUp tasks and adds new ClickUp tasks without
  touching native/manual CompanyCore tasks.
- [x] `skip_existing` leaves existing ClickUp tasks unchanged and adds only new
  ClickUp tasks.
- [x] `replace_selected_lists` deletes only `source = clickup` tasks under the
  selected ClickUp Lists after a successful provider fetch.
- [x] `inspect_only` fetches and reports would-create/would-update counts
  without writing or deleting tasks.
- [x] Imported ClickUp tasks preserve priority and land in the matching
  CompanyCore task list.
- [x] Production bootstrap exposes the same import policy and never prints raw
  secrets.
- [x] Architecture and API docs document the policy.
- [x] `npm run build`, `npx prisma validate`, `git diff --check`, and
  `npm test` pass.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Scope stayed inside the approved ClickUp first-run launch path.
- [x] Existing architecture mechanisms were reused instead of adding a
  parallel import system.
- [x] No temporary bypass, fake data path, or mock-only behavior was shipped.
- [x] Destructive behavior is fail-closed and provider-scoped.
- [x] Documentation and canonical project state are updated.
- [x] Validation evidence is recorded.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added explicit ClickUp import policies for `merge`,
  `skip_existing`, `replace_selected_lists`, and `inspect_only`; wired them
  through workspace settings, native sync API, owner console, production
  bootstrap, architecture/API/integration docs, and regression tests.
- Files changed: `.env.example`, `public/app.js`, `public/index.html`,

- How tested: Ran `npm run build`, `npx prisma validate` with local
  `DATABASE_URL`, `git diff --check`, and `npm test` against disposable
  PostgreSQL on `localhost:55432`.
- What is incomplete: Real ClickUp production token discovery/sync remains an
  operator action. Continuous automatic updates still require the queued
  scheduled-sync versus webhook-ingestion decision.
- Next steps: Deploy this commit, enter the real ClickUp token in the owner
  console, run `inspect_only` or `merge`, then decide continuous ClickUp update
  strategy after the first production pull succeeds.

- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-036
- Operation Mode: ARCHITECT

### Description
Plan the real-time ClickUp trigger layer so CompanyCore can listen to ClickUp
changes after the owner enables the integration and can notify Paperclip,
Jarvis, Aviary, and future modules through a provider-neutral CompanyCore event
bridge.

### Goal
Replace the open continuous-sync decision with an approved webhook-first
architecture based on current ClickUp documentation and split the work into
small executable implementation slices.

### Scope
- `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/planning/clickup-webhook-trigger-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Review official ClickUp webhook documentation before planning runtime
   behavior.
2. Record ClickUp-specific assumptions for registration, user-token ownership,
   health, task payloads, and `X-Signature` HMAC verification.
3. Define the CompanyCore webhook architecture: registration service, raw-body
   receiver, provider inbox, idempotent processor, and agent outbox.
4. Define how `taskStatusUpdated` becomes a Paperclip/Jarvis/Aviary-visible
   CompanyCore event.
5. Split implementation into CCV1-036A through CCV1-036F.
6. Update canonical queue files so webhook work is actionable immediately after
   first import.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Official ClickUp webhook docs are reflected in the plan.
- [x] Plan requires raw-body `X-Signature` HMAC SHA-256 verification.
- [x] Plan accounts for webhooks being tied to the creating ClickUp user token.
- [x] Plan includes webhook registration, health/reconciliation, receiver,
  inbox, processing, and retry/idempotency behavior.
- [x] Plan defines status-change propagation to Paperclip, Jarvis, Aviary, and
  future bridges.
- [x] Planning queue contains concrete implementation slices.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Architecture source of truth updated.
- [x] Integration docs updated.
- [x] Planning docs and task board synchronized.
- [x] No runtime code was changed before the architecture slice was approved.
- [x] Provider docs were checked and named in task evidence.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Approved a webhook-first continuous update model for ClickUp
  and documented the model as a reusable provider bridge architecture:
  ClickUp signed webhook -> CompanyCore verified inbox -> idempotent processor
  -> task update/internal event -> agent event bridge for Paperclip, Jarvis,
  Aviary, and future modules.
- Files changed: `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`,
  `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`, `docs/planning/clickup-webhook-trigger-plan.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and this
  task contract.
- How tested: Reviewed official ClickUp docs for Webhooks, Webhook Signature,
  Create Webhook, Get Webhooks, Update Webhook, Webhook Health, and task
  webhook payloads; ran `git diff --check` and `npm run build`.
- What is incomplete: Runtime webhook tables, receiver, registration, task
  processor, and agent event APIs are intentionally queued as CCV1-036A through
  CCV1-036F.

- Status: DONE
- Owner: Frontend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-032, CCV1-035
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-037
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Real owner testing confirmed ClickUp Workspace discovery works, but the owner
did not see an obvious List selection path after choosing the Workspace.

### Goal
Make the ClickUp List loading and multiselect flow explicit enough for first
production import: load Lists on demand, show clear no-list feedback, and allow
selecting or clearing all loaded Lists.

### Scope
- `public/index.html`
- `public/app.js`
- `public/styles.css`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Add an explicit `Load Lists` action next to the ClickUp Workspace selector.
2. Reuse the existing discovery endpoint and selected Workspace state.
3. Add `Select all` and `Clear all` controls for loaded Lists.
4. Improve List summary messaging for loaded, selected, and no-list states.
5. Validate the static frontend through TypeScript build and diff checks.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Owner can manually load Lists after selecting a ClickUp Workspace.
- [x] Owner can select all loaded Lists.
- [x] Owner can clear all selected Lists.
- [x] Empty ClickUp structure produces an actionable no-list message.
- [x] Existing save/sync enablement still requires at least one selected List.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Change stays inside the owner console selection flow.
- [x] Existing ClickUp discovery and sync APIs are reused.
- [x] No temporary fallback or fake provider data is added.
- [x] Canonical planning and project state are updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added explicit List loading and bulk selection controls to the
  ClickUp owner console, plus clearer feedback when a selected Workspace returns

## CCV1-038 Dashboard Task Table

### Header
- ID: CCV1-038
- Title: Dashboard task table
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Frontend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-035
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-038
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
After the first ClickUp import attempt, the owner needs a visible table in the
CompanyCore dashboard to confirm whether tasks were imported.

### Goal
Add the first dashboard data table for tasks, including ClickUp-visible fields
that prove import mapping worked: title, status, priority, list, source, and
due date.

### Scope
- `src/modules/tasks/tasks.routes.ts`
- `public/index.html`
- `public/app.js`
- `public/styles.css`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Extend task list API responses with safe task list metadata.
2. Add a dashboard task table with a manual refresh action.
3. Load tasks after owner connection and after ClickUp sync.
4. Render empty state and ClickUp count summary.
5. Add regression assertion that `/v1/tasks` includes imported task list
   metadata.
6. Run build, diff check, and integration tests.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Dashboard shows a tasks table for the active workspace.
- [x] Imported ClickUp tasks show source, priority, status, and task list.
- [x] Empty state is clear when there are no tasks.
- [x] Refresh button reloads tasks without rerunning ClickUp sync.
- [x] `/v1/tasks` remains workspace-scoped.
- [x] `npm test` passes.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Existing task API and dashboard shell were reused.
- [x] No fake data or placeholder-only behavior was added.
- [x] Task list relation data is safe and workspace-scoped.
- [x] Documentation and planning state are updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added the first dashboard data table for workspace tasks and
  included safe task list metadata in task list API responses so owners can
  verify ClickUp import results immediately.
- Files changed: `src/modules/tasks/tasks.routes.ts`, `public/index.html`,
  `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `src/tests/api.test.ts`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Ran `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL, `npm run build`,
  and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: This is the first table only; broader dashboard
  filtering/search/pagination remains future UX work.
- Next steps: Deploy, refresh Dashboard, and inspect imported ClickUp tasks.

## CCV1-039 ClickUp Config-Only Save Fix

### Header
- ID: CCV1-039
- Title: ClickUp config-only save fix
- Task Type: bugfix
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-035, CCV1-037
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-039
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Real owner testing showed `ClickUp is not configured for this workspace yet`
and `internal_server_error` after selecting ClickUp lists and attempting to save
or sync.

### Goal
Allow owners to update ClickUp configuration without re-pasting the token when
a workspace setting already exists, while preserving the encrypted ClickUp
secret.

### Scope
- `src/modules/integration-settings/integration-settings.routes.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Inspect production logs for the failing ClickUp save path.
2. Replace Prisma `upsert` data construction that encrypts an undefined token
   with explicit existing-update versus new-create paths.
3. Add a regression test for updating ClickUp config without token while
   preserving `secretConfigured`.
4. Run integration tests and diff checks.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Existing ClickUp integration settings can be updated without sending a
  token.
- [x] Config-only save preserves the encrypted token and `secretConfigured`.
- [x] New ClickUp integration settings still require a token.
- [x] Internal server error no longer occurs from `encryptSecret(undefined)`.
- [x] `npm test` passes.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Existing secret-storage mechanism is reused.
- [x] No plaintext token logging or response leakage is added.
- [x] Regression test covers the failed production path.
- [x] Canonical state and planning docs are updated.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Fixed ClickUp settings updates so config-only saves use an
  explicit update path that preserves existing encrypted token material instead
  of constructing a Prisma upsert create payload with `encryptSecret(undefined)`.
- Files changed:
  `src/modules/integration-settings/integration-settings.routes.ts`,
  `src/tests/api.test.ts`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this
  task contract.
- How tested: Ran `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL and
  `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Needs production deploy and owner retry in browser.
- Next steps: Deploy, hard-refresh the settings console, save ClickUp
  connection, then run sync/import and check Dashboard Tasks.

- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Frontend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-039
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-040
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Production inspection showed the owner-selected ClickUp lists and encrypted
token were saved, but the integration setting was inactive, so native sync
returned `integration_not_configured`.

### Goal
Make the owner console's `Save and sync` action activate the ClickUp connection
before triggering native sync, while preserving the ability to save an inactive
connection through the plain `Save connection` action.

### Scope
- `public/app.js`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Inspect production ClickUp setting metadata without exposing token material.
2. Confirm whether token, selected lists, and active state are present.
3. Update `Save and sync` to force `active=true`.
4. Keep `Save connection` respecting the Active checkbox.
5. Recompute button state when Active changes.
6. Run build and diff checks.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `Save and sync` activates ClickUp settings before sync.
- [x] Plain `Save connection` can still save an inactive connection.
- [x] Active checkbox changes update button state.
- [x] No token material is logged or returned.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Existing owner console flow is reused.
- [x] No backend bypass or direct token handling is added.
- [x] Production finding is recorded in project state.
- [x] Validation passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Fixed owner console behavior so `Save and sync` forces the
  ClickUp setting active before native sync, preventing an inactive saved
  setting from returning `integration_not_configured`.
- Files changed: `public/app.js`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this
  task contract.
- How tested: Ran `npm run build` and `git diff --check`.

- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-034A
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-034B
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Persist discovered ClickUp Workspaces, Spaces, Folders, and Lists into the
operating registry so imported records land under the right CompanyCore table
and task list.

### Scope
- `src/operating-model/clickup-structure.ts`
- `src/modules/integration-settings/integration-settings.routes.ts`
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.sync.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- context and planning files

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ClickUp discovery persists non-secret structural metadata.
- [x] ClickUp Spaces are mapped to operating areas.
- [x] ClickUp Folders are mapped to operating folders.
- [x] ClickUp Lists are mapped to operating tables with `source = clickup`.
- [x] Imported ClickUp tasks preserve priority.
- [x] Imported ClickUp tasks attach to the matching CompanyCore `task_lists`
  row by ClickUp List ID.
- [x] Tests prove a `Jarvis` ClickUp List maps to AI agents and observability
  and imported task list placement works.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm test` with disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55432`.
- Provider docs reviewed: ClickUp Tasks, Custom Fields, Views, Rate Limits,
  Webhook signature, and API v2/v3 terminology from the prior CCV1-034
  documentation task.
- High-risk checks: task priority and task list placement asserted in
  `src/tests/api.test.ts`.

### Result Report
- Task summary: ClickUp discovery now saves structural mappings, and native
  task sync uses those mappings to place imported tasks under the correct task
  list while preserving priority.
- Files changed: ClickUp structure service, integration settings route,
  ClickUp sync service, tests, docs, task board, project state, next commits,
  and this contract.
- How tested: build, migration deploy, and integration test.
- What is incomplete: Views and Custom Field metadata persistence are split to
  CCV1-034B2.
- Next steps: decide whether adapters need dedicated registry routes beyond
  `/v1/connection`.

- Task Type: research
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: CCV1-031, CCV1-032, CCV1-033
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-034
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] No loop step is skipped.
- [x] Exactly one priority task is selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches iteration 34.
- [x] The task aligns with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
The owner wants CompanyCore tables, APIs, automations, storage, and knowledge
roots to map 1:1 with ClickUp workspace/folder structure where useful, then
expand with strong ideas from other systems. The current schema is
workspace-scoped but does not yet persist a full ClickUp-equivalent hierarchy.

### Goal
Document the target operating model, audit the current database/code fit, and
queue the smallest safe implementation sequence before runtime schema changes.

### Scope
- `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/planning/clickup-shaped-operating-model-plan.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `.codex/context/LEARNING_JOURNAL.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Check official ClickUp docs for hierarchy, tasks, Custom Fields, Views,
   rate limits, and webhook signatures.
2. Compare the current Prisma schema and integration docs to the desired
   workspace/folder/table mapping.
3. Document the target 12-area operating model and system-table boundary.
4. Plan migration/API/storage/automation follow-up tasks without changing
   runtime behavior.
5. Update project state, board, learning journal, and validation evidence.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: current v1 tables have workspace ownership, but there is no explicit
  `Operating Area -> Operating Folder -> Operating Table` registry.
- Gaps: ClickUp Spaces, Folders, Views, Custom Fields, storage roots,
  knowledge roots, and automation scopes are not persisted as first-class
  records.
- Inconsistencies: `task_lists` approximates ClickUp Lists but is not a
  general table registry.
- Architecture constraints: PostgreSQL remains source of truth and all
  clients must use the API.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-034 ClickUp-shaped operating model architecture.
- Priority rationale: schema/code implementation needs an approved source of
  truth before adding new tables or sync behavior.
- Why other candidates were deferred: continuous ClickUp sync should wait
  until the structural registry decision is captured.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: architecture, database, integration, planning,
  task board, project state, and learning journal docs only.
- Logic: record the hierarchy and follow-up task sequence.
- Edge cases: keep system tables outside the 12 business areas; avoid
  pretending current code already mirrors ClickUp 1:1.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added the operating model architecture, database target
  registry, ClickUp structural mapping, and implementation plan.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: official ClickUp documentation review, schema/code
  inspection, `git diff --check`.
- Result: documentation-only validation passed.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: adding fields directly to `task_lists`.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: registry approach supports ClickUp now and future
  systems later without overloading domain tables.
- Refinements made: separated system tables from the 12 business areas.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: architecture, database, integrations, planning, board, project
  state, learning journal.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: yes.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Architecture defines the ClickUp-shaped hierarchy and 12 business areas.
- [x] Database docs identify current schema gaps and target registry tables.
- [x] Integration docs capture ClickUp hierarchy and provider-doc guardrails.
- [x] Planning docs queue implementation tasks for schema, mapping, API,
  storage/knowledge, and automations.
- [x] The current code is assessed without introducing runtime changes.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] Behavior is reproducible from the evidence recorded below.
- [x] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary path is introduced.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `git diff --check`.
- Manual checks: reviewed `prisma/schema.prisma`, `docs/DATABASE.md`,
  `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`, and official ClickUp docs.
- High-risk checks: no runtime or migration changes were made.

### Integration Evidence
- `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` reviewed: yes.
- Real API/service path used: not applicable.
- Endpoint and client contract match: not applicable.
- DB schema and migrations verified: docs-only audit; runtime schema unchanged.
- Regression check performed: documentation diff validation.

### Architecture Evidence
- Architecture source reviewed: `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`.
- Fits approved architecture: yes.
- Mismatch discovered: yes; current code lacks the full operating registry.
- Decision required from user: no; user requested documenting the direction and
  planning implementation.
- Follow-up architecture doc updates: added target model and provider-doc
  guardrail.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Documented CompanyCore's ClickUp-shaped operating model and
  planned the registry implementation sequence.
- Files changed: architecture, database, integrations, operating-model plan,
  project state, task board, next commits, learning journal, and this contract.
- How tested: official ClickUp documentation review, local schema/code audit,
  and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: runtime registry tables and APIs are queued as
  CCV1-034A through CCV1-034E.
- Next steps: implement CCV1-034A Operating Model Registry Schema.

### Implementation Plan
1. Verify official ClickUp API endpoints for token, Workspace, Space, Folder,
   List, and task-sync behavior.
2. Define the correct owner-console UX states.
3. Define backend discovery and sync changes.
4. Split implementation into backend, frontend, and production smoke tasks.
5. Update canonical planning queue.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Plan references official ClickUp API endpoint behavior.
- [x] Plan includes ClickUp Workspace selection before List selection.
- [x] Plan separates discovery, save, sync, and continuous-update scope.
- [x] Plan defines implementation tasks and deployment smoke.
- [x] Canonical queue is updated.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Plan is committed to canonical planning docs.
- [x] No runtime workaround is introduced.
- [x] Architecture source of truth remains API-first with minimal v1 GUI.

  Workspaces, Spaces, Folders, folder Lists, folderless Lists, and filtered
  Workspace tasks.
- Follow-up source review: official ClickUp docs for rate limits, webhooks,
  webhook signatures, and webhook creation.
- Local checks: documentation-only planning update.

### Result Report

  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: reviewed official docs, added coverage audit rows for rate
  limits, stored-token rediscovery, pagination, and webhook signature
  requirements, then checked queue consistency.

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with the newly approved v1 direction.

### Context
The owner approved changing v1 from no GUI to a minimal owner-only web console
for ClickUp setup. The backend remains API-first and separately scalable;
broader company dashboard and mobile are v2 scope.

### Goal
Add the smallest humane v1 UI for owner login, ClickUp activation, token entry,
settings save, and first native sync.

### Scope
- `public/index.html`
- `public/styles.css`
- `public/app.js`
- `src/app.ts`
- `Dockerfile`
- architecture, API, deployment, planning, and context docs

### Implementation Plan
1. Serve static owner console assets from the existing backend.
2. Let owners log in through `POST /auth/login`.
3. Load connection and ClickUp status through `GET /v1/connection`.
4. Save settings through `PUT /v1/integration-settings/clickup`.
5. Trigger first sync through `POST /v1/tasks/sync/clickup/native`.
6. Keep the backend/API boundary intact for agents and future clients.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Owner can load a web console from `/`.
- [x] Owner can log in with the existing owner account.
- [x] Owner can enable/disable ClickUp integration.
- [x] Owner can enter token, team ID, and list IDs.
- [x] Owner can save settings without exposing the stored token.
- [x] Owner can save and trigger native ClickUp sync from the UI.
- [x] Docs state v2 dashboard and mobile scope.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Code builds without errors.
- [x] Feature works through the real API surface.
- [x] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary path remains.
- [x] No existing functionality is broken.
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm run build`.
- Manual checks: started `node dist/server.js` on local port `3100` and
  confirmed `GET /` returned `200`.
- High-risk checks: no schema change; Docker runtime copies `public/` into the
  production image.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added a minimal owner-only static web console for ClickUp setup
  and sync while preserving the API-first backend architecture.
- Files changed: `public/index.html`, `public/styles.css`, `public/app.js`,
  `src/app.ts`, `Dockerfile`, architecture/API/deployment docs, task board,
  project state, next commits, and this task contract.
- How tested: `npm run build`; local static runtime smoke returned `200` for
  `/`.
- What is incomplete: v2 company dashboard and mobile app are intentionally out
  of scope; continuous ClickUp updates remain a follow-up strategy decision.
- Next steps: deploy, open `/`, log in, save ClickUp settings, and run sync.

## CCV1-029 ClickUp Production Bootstrap Slot

### Header
- ID: CCV1-029
- Title: ClickUp production bootstrap slot
- Task Type: release
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Ops/Release
- Depends on: CCV1-010, CCV1-013, CCV1-026
- Priority: P1
- Iteration: v1-029
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
The owner is ready to provide a real ClickUp token for production. Existing
architecture requires ClickUp credentials to belong to the workspace through
integration settings, not as permanent backend process globals.

### Goal
Prepare a safe operator path for entering the ClickUp token, saving workspace
ClickUp settings, and triggering the first native production pull sync.

### Scope
- `package.json`
- `scripts/clickup-production-bootstrap.mjs`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/operations/clickup-production-bootstrap.md`
- `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Add a dependency-free operator script that reads temporary env values.
2. Verify the CompanyCore service key with `/v1/connection`.
3. Save ClickUp settings through the protected integration settings API.
4. Trigger the native pull sync endpoint and print only safe counts.
5. Document the Coolify/operator handoff and current limitation around
   continuous updates.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- ClickUp native sync already exists and reads workspace-owned settings.
- There is no background worker or listener in v1.
- Production Jarvis/Paperclip service keys already exist, but ClickUp provider
  credentials are still missing.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-029 ClickUp production bootstrap slot.
- Priority rationale: enables the first real ClickUp data import without
  violating the workspace secret boundary.
- Why other candidates were deferred: continuous sync strategy needs a design
  decision after the first pull succeeds.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: package script, operator script, deployment and
  integration docs, canonical queue/context.
- Logic: configure settings and sync through public protected API only.
- Edge cases: missing env fails closed; tokens are never printed.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added `npm run clickup:bootstrap`.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `npm run build` and missing-env bootstrap invocation.
- Result: see Validation Evidence.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Architecture alignment: token is stored through workspace integration
  settings, not as a permanent backend env.
- Existing system reuse: reuses `/v1/integration-settings/clickup` and
  `/v1/tasks/sync/clickup/native`.
- No workaround: yes; this is an operator bootstrap around existing approved
  APIs.
- Duplication: no provider sync logic duplicated.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: operations bootstrap, Coolify deployment contract,
  integrations, task board, project state, next commits.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] A clear Coolify/operator place exists for the ClickUp token and list
  configuration.
- [x] The token is not committed or documented as raw secret material.
- [x] Bootstrap saves settings through the protected CompanyCore API.
- [x] Bootstrap triggers native ClickUp sync after settings are saved.
- [x] Docs state that continuous listening is not active yet.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Code builds without errors.
- [x] Feature works through the real API surface when production credentials
  are provided.
- [x] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary path remains.
- [x] No existing functionality is broken.
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm run build`.
- Manual checks: `npm run clickup:bootstrap` without env fails closed and lists
  missing env names without printing secrets.
- High-risk checks: no schema or runtime secret model changes.

### Integration Evidence
- `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` reviewed: yes.
- Real API/service path used: yes; script uses CompanyCore HTTP API.
- Endpoint and client contract match: yes.
- DB schema and migrations verified: not applicable.
- Error state verified: missing env fails closed.
- Regression check performed: TypeScript build.

### Security / Privacy Evidence
- `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md` reviewed: yes.
- Data classification: ClickUp provider token and operational task data.
- Trust boundaries: operator shell/Coolify secret input, CompanyCore API key,
  workspace integration settings.
- Permission or ownership checks: active workspace is derived from the
  CompanyCore service API key.
- Secret handling: tokens are read from env, sent over HTTPS to CompanyCore,
  encrypted at rest, and never printed.
- Fail-closed behavior: missing env or failed API calls exit non-zero.

### Deployment / Ops Evidence
- Deploy impact: script and docs only; backend runtime behavior unchanged.
- Env or secret changes: temporary operator env values documented.
- Health-check impact: none.
- Smoke steps updated: yes.
- Rollback note: remove the script/docs or redeploy the previous commit; no DB
  migration involved.
- `DEPLOYMENT_GATE.md` reviewed: yes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added a safe operator bootstrap path for production ClickUp
  token entry and first native pull sync.
- Files changed: `package.json`, `scripts/clickup-production-bootstrap.mjs`,
  `.env.example`, `docs/operations/clickup-production-bootstrap.md`,
  `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`,
  `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this
  task contract.
- How tested: `npm run build` and missing-env bootstrap invocation.
- What is incomplete: continuous ClickUp listening/scheduled sync remains a
  follow-up decision.
- Next steps: run the bootstrap with real production token, team ID, list IDs,
  and a CompanyCore workspace service key.

## v1 Architecture Addendum: Workspace Ownership

CompanyCore v1 must include a workspace ownership boundary. Registration creates
an owner user and workspace atomically. Business data, API keys, integration
settings, and integration sync state must resolve to a workspace before writes
are accepted. This is not full enterprise multi-tenancy: no invitations,
billing, advanced RBAC, or organization admin UI are planned for v1.

## v1 Regression Guardrails

Every runtime task must preserve these rules:

- protected routes resolve `workspaceId`
- cross-workspace access fails closed
- integration secrets are not logged or returned
- external sync is idempotent per `(workspace_id, source, external_id)`
- schema changes use migrations
- significant state changes emit events
- API errors use stable, safe response codes
- tests include allowed and denied paths

## CCV1-026 Adapter Smoke Script

### Header
- ID: CCV1-026
- Title: Adapter smoke script
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: QA/Test
- Depends on: CCV1-025
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-026
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
Paperclip/Jarvis integration readiness needs a repeatable operator check that
uses the same public API surface the adapters will use. Production protected
smoke is still blocked until a real service API key exists.

### Goal
Add a local smoke script that validates the full adapter onboarding flow using
`COMPANYCORE_BASE_URL` and `COMPANYCORE_API_KEY`.

### Scope
- `package.json`
- `scripts/adapter-smoke.mjs`
- `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`
- `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Add a dependency-free Node smoke script using global `fetch`.
2. Call `/v1/connection` and assert required capabilities.
3. Create one agent, task list, task, interaction, and agent log.
4. Read events and verify expected event types.
5. Document env vars and the command for operators.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: protected production smoke could not be completed without a service
  key.
- Gaps: no one-command adapter readiness check existed.
- Inconsistencies: docs described the flow but did not provide an executable
  verification tool.
- Architecture constraints: use public API only; do not connect to DB.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-026 adapter smoke script.
- Priority rationale: lets the owner verify Paperclip/Jarvis readiness as soon
  as a service key exists.
- Why other candidates were deferred: production key creation still needs owner
  credentials.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: package script, smoke script, adapter docs,
  deployment smoke evidence, context.
- Logic: fail closed on missing env, non-2xx responses, missing capabilities,
  or missing events.
- Edge cases: never print API key; support current string or envelope error
  shape.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added `npm run adapter:smoke` with no new dependency.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `npm run build`, `npm test`, and missing-env smoke
  invocation.
- Result: pending when first recorded; final result is in Validation Evidence.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: docs-only curl checklist.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: script exercises the same contract future adapters
  use and can grow as adapter capabilities grow.
- Refinements made: script redacts by omission and does not print secret env.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: adapter onboarding, post-deploy smoke, task contract, project
  state, task board.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `npm run adapter:smoke` exists.
- [x] Script fails closed when base URL or API key is missing.
- [x] Script calls `/v1/connection` before writing records.
- [x] Script writes through API only and verifies events.
- [x] Script does not print the API key.
- [x] Docs explain how to run the script for Paperclip/Jarvis.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Code builds without errors.
- [x] Feature works through the real API surface when credentials are provided.
- [x] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary path remains.
- [x] No existing functionality is broken.
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at disposable PostgreSQL.
- Manual checks: `npm run adapter:smoke` without env returns a clear missing
  env failure and does not print secrets.
- High-risk checks: no schema or secret changes.

### Integration Evidence
- `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` reviewed: yes.
- Real API/service path used: yes; script uses only HTTP API.
- Endpoint and client contract match: yes.
- DB schema and migrations verified: not applicable.
- Error state verified: missing env fails closed.
- Regression check performed: existing protected API flow test.

### Security / Privacy Evidence
- `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md` reviewed: yes.
- Data classification: workspace adapter smoke records.
- Trust boundaries: service API key boundary and public API boundary.
- Permission or ownership checks: relies on workspace-scoped service API key.
- Secret handling: API key is read from env and not printed.
- Fail-closed behavior: missing env, missing capabilities, failed writes, or
  missing events exit non-zero.

### Deployment / Ops Evidence
- Deploy impact: none for runtime; operator script only.
- Env or secret changes: none.
- Health-check impact: none.
- Smoke steps updated: yes.
- Rollback note: remove script or redeploy previous commit if needed.
- `DEPLOYMENT_GATE.md` reviewed: yes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added a service-adapter smoke script for Paperclip/Jarvis
  readiness verification.
- Files changed: `package.json`, `scripts/adapter-smoke.mjs`,
  `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`,
  `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and this
  task contract.
- How tested: `npm test` and missing-env smoke invocation.
- What is incomplete: protected production smoke still needs a real production
  service API key.

## CCV1-025 Task List And Pipeline Stage API

### Header
- ID: CCV1-025
- Title: Task list and pipeline stage API
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-019, CCV1-024
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-025
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
Task lists and pipeline stages were in the database and referenced by tasks and
deals, but they did not have runtime API routes. Adapters need these lightweight
configuration records to organize tasks and CRM deals safely.

### Goal
Add workspace-scoped list/create/update routes for task lists and pipeline
stages, emit create/update events, and expose the routes in the adapter
manifest.

### Scope
- `src/app.ts`
- `src/modules/task-lists/task-lists.routes.ts`
- `src/modules/task-lists/README.md`
- `src/modules/pipeline-stages/pipeline-stages.routes.ts`

- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Reuse the existing `TaskList` and `PipelineStage` models.
2. Add `GET`, `POST`, and `PATCH` routes only.
3. Validate optional `projectId` on task lists against the active workspace.
4. Emit create/update events through the existing event service.
5. Extend tests for creation, update, cross-workspace denial, list isolation,
   and manifest coverage.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: tasks and deals could reference records that adapters could not
  manage through the API.
- Gaps: task-list and pipeline-stage modules were README-only placeholders.
- Inconsistencies: schema supported these records, but API did not.
- Architecture constraints: API-only access, workspace scoping, no GUI.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-025 task list and pipeline stage API.
- Priority rationale: closes two remaining DB-backed configuration surfaces
  needed for adapter-created tasks and deals.
- Why other candidates were deferred: destructive delete semantics require a
  separate retention decision.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: two route modules, app mount, connection
  manifest, tests, docs, context.
- Logic: derive `workspaceId`, validate task-list project relation, persist
  records, emit events.
- Edge cases: foreign `projectId` must return `not_found`; foreign record
  updates must return `not_found`.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added root aliases and `/v1` routes through the
  existing protected route mounting.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL.
- Result: pending when first recorded; final result is in Validation Evidence.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: leave these as seed-only records.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: routes reuse existing workspace and event patterns.
- Refinements made: delete was explicitly deferred to avoid accidental data
  loss around related tasks/deals.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: API, adapter onboarding, module READMEs, task contract, project
  state, task board.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `GET /v1/task-lists` and `GET /v1/pipeline-stages` list only active
  workspace records.
- [x] `POST` routes create records in the active workspace.
- [x] `PATCH` routes update only active workspace records.
- [x] Task-list `projectId` is accepted only for active workspace projects.
- [x] Create/update events are emitted.
- [x] Adapter manifest includes both surfaces.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Code builds without errors.
- [x] Feature works through the real API surface.
- [x] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary data/path remains.
- [x] No existing functionality is broken.
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at disposable PostgreSQL.

- High-risk checks: no schema or secret changes.

### Integration Evidence
- `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` reviewed: yes.
- Real API/service path used: yes.
- Endpoint and client contract match: yes.
- DB schema and migrations verified: not applicable; existing models reused.
- Error state verified: foreign `projectId` in task-list creation returns
  `404`.
- Regression check performed: existing protected API flow test.

### Security / Privacy Evidence
- `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md` reviewed: yes.
- Data classification: workspace operational and CRM configuration.
- Trust boundaries: protected API and workspace auth context.
- Permission or ownership checks: all operations derive `workspaceId`; task
  list relation IDs are workspace-validated.
- Secret handling: no secrets returned or stored by these routes.
- Fail-closed behavior: protected route auth and foreign relation denial.

### Deployment / Ops Evidence
- Deploy impact: low.
- Env or secret changes: none.
- Health-check impact: none.
- Smoke steps updated: adapter onboarding docs updated.
- Rollback note: redeploy previous commit if adapter route causes regression.
- `DEPLOYMENT_GATE.md` reviewed: yes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added minimal workspace-scoped task-list and pipeline-stage API
  routes with event emission and adapter manifest coverage.
- Files changed: `src/app.ts`,

- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-019, CCV1-023
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-024
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
CompanyCore stores CRM interactions in the database, but Paperclip/Jarvis-style
clients did not yet have an API surface for writing lead/customer timeline
activity.

### Goal
Add minimal workspace-scoped `GET /v1/interactions` and
`POST /v1/interactions` routes, emit `interaction_created`, and expose the
route in the adapter manifest.

### Scope
- `src/app.ts`
- `src/modules/interactions/interactions.routes.ts`

- `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Reuse the existing `Interaction` model and workspace auth context.
2. Add list and create routes only; defer update/delete until a real adapter
   lifecycle need exists.
3. Validate optional `clientId` against the active workspace.
4. Emit `interaction_created` through the existing event service.
5. Extend tests for same-workspace creation, cross-workspace relation denial,
   and manifest coverage.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: interactions existed in DB but had no runtime API.
- Gaps: Paperclip lead/customer timeline activity would otherwise be forced
  into notes or logs.
- Inconsistencies: `interactions` was part of the source-of-truth model but not
  an implemented route module.
- Architecture constraints: API-only access, workspace scoping, no GUI.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-024 workspace-scoped interactions API.
- Priority rationale: closes a direct Paperclip/Jarvis CRM write path.
- Why other candidates were deferred: pipeline stages and task lists are useful
  but less urgent for adapter onboarding than CRM timeline writes.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: interactions route, app mount, connection
  manifest, tests, docs, context.
- Logic: derive `workspaceId` from auth, validate `clientId`, persist
  interaction, emit event.
- Edge cases: foreign `clientId` must return `not_found`.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added `GET/POST /interactions` root aliases and
  `/v1/interactions` through the existing protected route mounting.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL.
- Result: pending when first recorded; final result is in Validation Evidence.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: store CRM timeline in notes.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: route uses the existing model and workspace
  guardrails; future lifecycle endpoints can extend the module.
- Refinements made: kept scope to list/create instead of adding premature
  update/delete.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: API, integrations, adapter onboarding, task contract, project
  state, task board.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `GET /v1/interactions` lists only active workspace interactions.
- [x] `POST /v1/interactions` creates an interaction in the active workspace.
- [x] Optional `clientId` is accepted only for active workspace clients.
- [x] Interaction creation emits `interaction_created`.
- [x] Adapter manifest includes interactions routes and capabilities.
- [x] Docs explain interaction usage for adapters.

### Security / Privacy Evidence
- `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md` reviewed: yes.
- Data classification: workspace CRM activity.
- Trust boundaries: protected API and workspace auth context.
- Permission or ownership checks: list/create derive `workspaceId`; optional
  `clientId` is workspace-validated.

- Fail-closed behavior: protected route auth and foreign relation denial.

### Deployment / Ops Evidence
- Deploy impact: low.
- Env or secret changes: none.

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
CompanyCore already stored agents and agent logs, but only logs had runtime
routes. Paperclip/Jarvis-style clients need a durable agent identity before
writing operational logs.

### Goal
Add minimal workspace-scoped `GET /v1/agents` and `POST /v1/agents` routes,
emit an `agent_created` event, and expose the capability in the adapter
manifest.

### Scope
- `src/app.ts`
- `src/modules/agents/agents.routes.ts`
- `src/modules/agents/README.md`
- `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Reuse the existing `Agent` model and workspace auth context.
2. Add list and create routes only; defer update/delete until a real adapter
   lifecycle need exists.
3. Emit `agent_created` through the existing event service.
4. Extend tests for same-workspace creation, cross-workspace isolation, and
   log attachment denial.
5. Update adapter docs and connection manifest.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: logs could reference agents, but adapters could not create/list agent
  identities through the API.
- Gaps: missing runtime route for an existing source-of-truth model.
- Inconsistencies: agent table was documented as future-only while adapters now
  need it.
- Architecture constraints: API-only access, workspace scoping, no GUI.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-023 workspace-scoped agents API.
- Priority rationale: unlocks durable Paperclip/Jarvis identity and log
  attribution.
- Why other candidates were deferred: production protected smoke still needs
  real credentials; update/delete lifecycle can wait.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: agents route, app mount, connection manifest,
  tests, docs, context.
- Logic: derive `workspaceId` from auth, persist agent, emit event.
- Edge cases: foreign `agentId` in logs must remain denied.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added `GET/POST /agents` root aliases and `/v1/agents`
  through the existing protected route mounting.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL.
- Result: pending when first recorded; final result is in Validation Evidence.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: keep agent identity only in log metadata.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: route uses existing model and workspace guardrails;
  future lifecycle endpoints can extend this module.
- Refinements made: kept scope to list/create instead of adding premature
  update/delete.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: API, integrations, adapter onboarding, module README, task
  contract, project state, task board.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `GET /v1/agents` lists only active workspace agents.
- [x] `POST /v1/agents` creates an agent in the active workspace.
- [x] Agent creation emits `agent_created`.
- [x] Agent logs can attach to same-workspace agents and reject foreign agents.
- [x] Adapter manifest includes agents routes and capabilities.
- [x] Docs explain agent identity usage for adapters.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Code builds without errors.
- [x] Feature works through the real API surface.
- [x] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary data/path remains.
- [x] No existing functionality is broken.
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at disposable PostgreSQL.
- Manual checks: endpoint behavior covered by integration test.
- High-risk checks: no schema or secret changes.

### Integration Evidence
- `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` reviewed: yes.
- Real API/service path used: yes.
- Endpoint and client contract match: yes.
- DB schema and migrations verified: not applicable; existing model reused.
- Error state verified: foreign `agentId` in log creation returns `404`.
- Regression check performed: existing protected API flow test.

### Security / Privacy Evidence
- `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md` reviewed: yes.
- Data classification: workspace business metadata and operational memory.
- Trust boundaries: protected API and workspace auth context.
- Permission or ownership checks: list/create derive `workspaceId`; log
  attachment verifies same-workspace agent.
- Secret handling: no secrets returned or stored by this route.
- Fail-closed behavior: protected route auth and foreign relation denial.

### Deployment / Ops Evidence
- Deploy impact: low.
- Env or secret changes: none.
- Health-check impact: none.
- Smoke steps updated: adapter onboarding docs updated.
- Rollback note: redeploy previous commit if adapter route causes regression.
- `DEPLOYMENT_GATE.md` reviewed: yes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added minimal workspace-scoped agents API and adapter manifest
  coverage.
- Files changed: `src/app.ts`, `src/modules/agents/agents.routes.ts`,
  `src/modules/agents/README.md`,
  `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`, `src/tests/api.test.ts`,

  `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and this
  task contract.
- How tested: `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL.
- What is incomplete: no update/delete agent lifecycle routes in this slice.
- Next steps: issue production API keys for Paperclip/Jarvis and run protected
  production smoke.

## CCV1-022 Adapter Manifest For Service Clients

### Header
- ID: CCV1-022
- Title: Adapter manifest for service clients
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-021
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-022
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with the adapter source-of-truth contract.

### Context
Paperclip, Jarvis, Jarvan, Aviary, n8n, and similar service clients need the
first handshake to be useful without a GUI. The existing `/v1/connection`
endpoint proves auth and workspace identity, but adapters also benefit from a
small machine-readable route map.

### Goal
Expose canonical v1 routes, methods, capabilities, auth headers, and write
rules through the existing safe connection handshake.

### Scope
- `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Reuse `/v1/connection`; do not add a parallel discovery system.
2. Add a static safe `adapterManifest` with canonical v1 paths.
3. Cover the manifest in the existing protected API flow test.
4. Document how adapters should read the manifest before writing records.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: adapters can verify auth, but need a route map to avoid hardcoding
  startup assumptions.
- Gaps: no machine-readable canonical route list in runtime responses.
- Inconsistencies: none found; `/v1/connection` is the approved onboarding
  surface.
- Architecture constraints: API remains the access layer; no GUI and no direct
  database access for adapters.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-022 adapter manifest for service clients.
- Priority rationale: directly improves Paperclip/Jarvis connection readiness.
- Why other candidates were deferred: protected production smoke still needs a
  production workspace key; GitHub webhook setup still needs GitHub auth.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: connection route, endpoint test, API and
  integration docs, canonical context.
- Logic: return safe static metadata under `data.adapterManifest`.
- Edge cases: manifest must not include raw keys, owner tokens, or provider
  secrets.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added route groups for connection, projects, goals,
  targets, tasks, clients, deals, notes, decisions, agent logs, events, and
  ClickUp settings.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL.
- Result: pending when first recorded; final result is in Validation Evidence.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: docs-only onboarding.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: future adapters can extend the same manifest without
  introducing a separate discovery service.
- Refinements made: kept the manifest under the existing protected handshake.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: API, integrations, adapter onboarding, task contract, project
  state, task board.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `GET /v1/connection` includes `adapterManifest`.
- [x] Manifest lists canonical `/v1` paths, HTTP methods, and capabilities for
  adapter-facing v1 routes.
- [x] Manifest documents service auth header and write rules.
- [x] Endpoint test asserts representative manifest content.
- [x] Docs explain how Paperclip/Jarvis-style adapters should use the manifest.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Code builds without errors.
- [x] Feature works through the real API surface.
- [x] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary data/path remains.
- [x] No existing functionality is broken.
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] Behavior is reproducible from the evidence recorded below.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at disposable PostgreSQL.
- Manual checks: endpoint behavior covered by integration test.
- High-risk checks: manifest contains only static routes and safe auth metadata.

### Integration Evidence
- `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` reviewed: yes.
- Real API/service path used: yes.
- Endpoint and client contract match: yes.
- DB schema and migrations verified: not applicable.
- Error state verified: existing unauthenticated protected route test remains.
- Regression check performed: existing protected API flow test.

### Security / Privacy Evidence
- `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md` reviewed: yes.
- Data classification: non-secret API metadata.
- Trust boundaries: protected API handshake with workspace auth context.
- Permission or ownership checks: existing `requireApiKey`/bearer auth path.
- Abuse cases: manifest must not expose secrets or cross-workspace data.
- Secret handling: no raw key, token, password, or provider secret is returned.
- Fail-closed behavior: auth failures remain `401`/`403`.

### Deployment / Ops Evidence
- Deploy impact: low.
- Env or secret changes: none.
- Health-check impact: none.
- Smoke steps updated: adapter onboarding docs updated.
- Rollback note: redeploy the previous commit if adapters reject the response.
- `DEPLOYMENT_GATE.md` reviewed: yes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Expanded `/v1/connection` with a safe adapter manifest for
  service clients.
- Files changed: `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`,
  `src/tests/api.test.ts`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`,

  task contract.
- How tested: `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL.
- What is incomplete: protected production smoke still needs real production
  owner/service credentials.

## CCV1-018 Owner-Managed Adapter API Keys

### Header
- ID: CCV1-018
- Title: Owner-managed adapter API keys
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Security
- Depends on: CCV1-007, CCV1-006
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-018
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Add a safe owner-controlled API key management path so adapters such as Jarvan
and Aviary can be connected without GUI work, seed reruns, or direct database
access.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Owner can create a workspace service API key through `/v1/api-keys`.
- [x] New API keys are stored hashed and not stored as plaintext in the legacy
  `key` column.
- [x] Raw key is returned only once on creation.
- [x] List/update responses redact raw key material.
- [x] Service API keys cannot create more API keys.
- [x] Created key works with `X-API-Key`.
- [x] `npm test` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added owner-only service API key management for adapter
  onboarding, including generated `cc_v1_*` keys, hash-only storage for new
  keys, redacted list/update responses, activation toggling, and test coverage.
- Files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `prisma/migrations/202605027_api_key_management/migration.sql`,
  `prisma/seed.ts`, `src/auth/api-key.ts`, `src/app.ts`,

  `docs/engineering/testing.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Ran `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL at `localhost:55432`;
  the command applied all 7 migrations from scratch and passed endpoint tests.
- What is incomplete: A richer UI for key rotation remains out of v1 scope.
- Follow-up fix: After first production redeploy returned `503`, updated
  `prisma/seed.ts` to find an existing legacy plaintext seed API key before
  creating a hash-backed row, preventing duplicate key conflicts during
  transition deploys.
- Next steps: Push and let auto-deploy run, then rerun CCV1-009 production
  smoke.

## CCV1-021 Adapter Connection Handshake For Paperclip And Jarvis

### Header
- ID: CCV1-021
- Title: Adapter connection handshake for Paperclip and Jarvis
- Task Type: feature

- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-018, CCV1-019
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-021
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Context
Paperclip, Jarvis, Jarvan, Aviary, and similar adapters need a stable first API
call that proves their key works and tells them what CompanyCore can safely do
for the active workspace.

### Goal
Expose a safe connection handshake that returns API version, workspace identity,
auth type, capabilities, and non-secret integration readiness.

### Scope
- `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`
- `src/app.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`
- `.codex/context/*`

### Implementation Plan
1. Add a protected `/connection` route mounted at root and `/v1`.
2. Return only safe auth, workspace, capability, and integration metadata.
3. Add endpoint coverage using a workspace service API key.
4. Document adapter environment variables and first-call sequence.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `GET /v1/connection` works with `X-API-Key`.
- [x] Response contains service name, API version, workspace identity, auth
  type, capabilities, and ClickUp readiness.
- [x] Response does not include raw API keys or integration tokens.
- [x] Endpoint test covers service-key handshake.
- [x] Adapter onboarding docs explain Paperclip/Jarvis setup.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added a service-adapter handshake and onboarding doc so
  Paperclip/Jarvis-style clients can connect through CompanyCore safely.
- Files changed: `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`, `src/app.ts`,
  `src/tests/api.test.ts`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`,
  `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: `npm run build` and `npm test` against a disposable PostgreSQL
  database.
- What is incomplete: Production adapter smoke still needs an actual
  production workspace service API key.
- Next steps: Create/obtain Paperclip and Jarvis production API keys, store
  them in those apps, and call `/v1/connection`.

## CCV1-019 Database/API Workspace Coverage For Core Records

### Header
- ID: CCV1-019
- Title: Database/API workspace coverage for core records
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-012, CCV1-018
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-019
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with the workspace source-of-truth contract.

### Context
Owner auth and workspace-scoped API keys existed, but several business tables
and routes still behaved as global records. That could leak operational data
between workspaces once more owners or adapter keys exist.

### Goal
Make remaining core business records workspace-owned at the database and API
layers, and reject foreign relation IDs before creating dependent records.

### Scope
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `prisma/migrations/202605028_workspace_core_records/migration.sql`
- `prisma/seed.ts`
- protected route modules for projects, goals, targets, tasks, clients, deals,
  notes, decisions, agent logs, and events
- ClickUp sync event emission
- endpoint integration tests
- API/database/planning/context docs

### Implementation Plan
1. Add nullable `workspace_id` columns, indexes, and foreign keys for remaining
   core tables so existing production data is preserved.
2. Persist `workspaceId` from auth context on new protected records and events.
3. Filter protected list routes by active workspace.
4. Validate supplied relation IDs against the active workspace.
5. Expand integration tests for cross-workspace visibility and relation denial.
6. Update source-of-truth docs and context.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Core business tables have workspace ownership columns.
- [x] Protected reads for implemented routes filter by active workspace.
- [x] Protected writes persist `workspaceId` from auth context.
- [x] Foreign relation IDs from another workspace return `not_found`.
- [x] Events are workspace-scoped.
- [x] Fresh `prisma migrate deploy` succeeds.
- [x] Endpoint integration tests pass.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added workspace ownership for remaining core records and closed
  global-list leakage for implemented protected routes.
- Files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `prisma/migrations/202605028_workspace_core_records/migration.sql`,

  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` against a
  disposable fresh PostgreSQL database.
- What is incomplete: Protected production smoke still needs approved
  production owner/API-key credentials and ClickUp settings.
- Next steps: Complete CCV1-009P protected production smoke when credentials
  are available.

- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: Audit findings from 2026-05-02
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-001
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Make the canonical architecture and operations documents reflect the actual
CompanyCore v1 backend-only architecture.

### Scope
- `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- `docs/architecture/architecture-source-of-truth.md`
- `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Compare current short-form docs in `docs/*.md` with canonical architecture
   and operations docs.
2. Replace active template placeholders with CompanyCore-specific truth.
3. Keep the approved v1 boundary: no GUI, API as access layer, PostgreSQL as
   source of truth, native ClickUp adapter as the first integration pattern,
   and n8n as optional orchestration.
4. Record deployment topology, private Postgres, public API, and required
   secrets.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Canonical architecture docs no longer describe placeholder systems.
- [x] Docs clearly state that CompanyCore v1 has no GUI.
- [x] Docs clearly state the
  `ClickUp API -> CompanyCore adapter -> DB -> event` flow.
- [x] Deployment contract lists backend, Postgres, volume, health check, and
  required secrets.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Docs are updated in English.
- [x] No runtime code changes are included.
- [x] Planning and project state remain synchronized.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Replaced canonical architecture and deployment placeholders
  with CompanyCore-specific backend-only architecture, workspace ownership,
  native ClickUp adapter direction, tech stack, and Coolify deployment contract.
- Files changed: `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`,
  `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`,
  `docs/architecture/architecture-source-of-truth.md`,
  `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Searched canonical docs for old template placeholder language,
  reviewed docs for the required architecture statements, and ran
  `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Runtime implementation is unchanged; CCV1-011 must still
  finalize detailed workspace/auth schema and auth-context contract.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-011.

## CCV1-002 Real Planning Queue And Task Contracts

### Goal
Replace template planning placeholders with a real, dependency-aware
CompanyCore v1 execution queue.

### Scope
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/open-decisions.md`
- `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Convert audit findings into `NOW`, `NEXT`, and `PIPELINE` work.
2. Add task contracts for each planned v1 slice.
3. Record open decisions that block route, auth, and migration details.
4. Synchronize task board and project state.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] No placeholder `PRJ-001` planning rows remain in active planning files.
- [x] Every queued v1 task has title, description, files likely affected,
  acceptance criteria, and priority.
- [x] Open decisions are explicit and assigned to future tasks.
- [x] Current project state points to the next executable slice.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Planning docs are updated in English.
- [x] No runtime implementation is included.
- [x] `npm run build` is optional because this is docs-only; run it only if
  code is touched.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Replaced placeholder planning with the CCV1 execution queue,
  task contracts, open decisions, task board updates, and project-state handoff.
- Files changed: `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`,

  `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, and
  `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`.
- How tested: Searched active planning/context files for old placeholder task
  markers and reviewed the git diff. No runtime code changed.
- What is incomplete: Canonical architecture and operations docs still need
  CCV1-001.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-001.

## CCV1-003 Prisma Migration Baseline And Deployment Entrypoint

- `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] A baseline migration represents the current Prisma schema.
- [x] Workspace/auth/integration settings schema changes are represented by
  explicit migrations when those tasks are implemented.
- [x] Production startup no longer depends on uncontrolled `prisma db push`.
- [x] Local development still has a documented schema setup path.
- [x] Deployment docs describe migration command, rollback trigger, and backup
  expectation.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added a baseline Prisma migration for the existing v1 schema,
  added migration scripts, switched the Docker runtime startup to
  `prisma migrate deploy`, and updated deployment/rollback docs.

- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-010
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Implement ClickUp as the first native CompanyCore integration adapter so Jarvis
and future AI agents can use CompanyCore directly without requiring separate
n8n workflows.

### Goal
Create the reusable integration pattern for external systems by adding a
minimal, production-shaped ClickUp adapter that can fetch ClickUp task data,
normalize it, persist it through existing CompanyCore models inside the active
workspace, and emit events.

### Scope
- `src/integrations/clickup/*`
- `src/modules/tasks/*`
- `src/modules/events/*`
- `src/config/env.ts`
- `prisma/schema.prisma` and migrations only if integration state tables are
  approved
- `.env.example`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`
- `docs/operations/service-reliability-and-observability.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Define the smallest approved v1 ClickUp scope from DEC-005 before coding.
2. Read ClickUp configuration from workspace integration settings, with only
   encryption/application secrets coming from environment variables.
3. Build a dedicated ClickUp client/adapter under `src/integrations/clickup`.
4. Normalize ClickUp tasks into the existing `Task` model with `source =
   clickup`, `externalId`, and the active `workspaceId`.
5. Reuse existing task upsert and event creation behavior where possible.
6. Add an authenticated endpoint or service command to trigger sync.
7. Record failure behavior, retry expectations, and observability notes.

### Files Likely Affected
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.client.ts`
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.mapper.ts`
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.sync.ts`
- `src/modules/tasks/tasks.routes.ts`

- workspace integration settings modules from CCV1-013
- `.env.example`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] CompanyCore can call the ClickUp API using workspace-owned credentials.
- [x] ClickUp tasks are normalized into CompanyCore tasks inside the active
  workspace.
- [x] Sync upserts by `(workspace_id, source = clickup, external_id)`.
- [x] Sync emits `task_synced_from_clickup`.
- [x] Integration failures return safe API errors and do not corrupt existing
  tasks.
- [x] ClickUp secrets are not logged, not returned by API responses, and are
  documented in integration/deployment docs.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Implemented the first native ClickUp pull-sync adapter with a
  provider client, mapper, sync service, protected trigger route, task
  workspace ownership, idempotent task upsert, and sync events.

- How tested: Reviewed official ClickUp API docs for task filtering, ran
  `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`, `npx prisma validate` with a local
  `DATABASE_URL`, and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Automated endpoint tests and real ClickUp production
  smoke remain in CCV1-006 and CCV1-009.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `POST /auth/register` or approved equivalent creates owner user and
  workspace atomically.
- [x] Duplicate email/owner registration is handled safely.
- [x] `POST /auth/login` or approved equivalent authenticates the owner.
- [x] Passwords or login secrets are hashed; plaintext credentials are never
  stored.
- [x] Protected routes can resolve `workspaceId`.
- [x] `GET /health` remains public.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added owner registration/login, signed bearer auth tokens,
  password hashing, workspace and owner membership models, workspace-aware API
  key context, and local seed bootstrap for an owner workspace.

- How tested: Ran `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`,
  `npx prisma validate` with a local `DATABASE_URL`, and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Workspace scoping is available in auth context, but
  existing business routes still need filtering/persistence by workspace in
  later scoped tasks.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-013 workspace-scoped integration settings and secret
  storage.

## CCV1-013 Workspace-Scoped Integration Settings And Secret Storage

### Header
- ID: CCV1-013
- Title: Workspace-scoped integration settings and secret storage
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-011, CCV1-012, CCV1-003
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-013
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Add the storage and API contract for workspace-owned integration settings,
starting with ClickUp credentials and sync configuration.

### Goal
Store integration configuration under the workspace so ClickUp and future
integrations are not global process settings. Secrets must be protected,
non-leaking, and usable by native integration adapters.

### Files Likely Affected
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `prisma/migrations/*`
- `src/modules/integration-settings/*`
- `src/integrations/*`
- `src/config/env.ts`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Workspace can store ClickUp token/config through an authenticated route or
  approved bootstrap path.
- [x] Integration settings are tied to `workspaceId`.
- [x] Secret values are encrypted or otherwise protected according to the
  approved v1 security plan.
- [x] Secret values are never returned in API responses or logs.
- [x] Cross-workspace access is rejected.
- [x] ClickUp adapter contract reads settings through this workspace-scoped
  mechanism.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added workspace-owned integration settings, encrypted provider
  secret storage, ClickUp settings routes, and service helpers for native
  adapters to read decrypted workspace settings inside the backend process.
- Files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `prisma/migrations/202605023_integration_settings/migration.sql`,
  `.env.example`, `src/config/env.ts`, `src/app.ts`,
  `src/integrations/secrets.ts`,
  `src/integrations/integration-settings.service.ts`,
  `src/modules/integration-settings/integration-settings.routes.ts`,

  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Ran `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`,
  `npx prisma validate` with a local `DATABASE_URL`, and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Native ClickUp API calls and sync behavior remain in
  CCV1-010 after CCV1-017 defines the adapter observability contract.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-017 integration adapter contract and observability
  minimum, then implement CCV1-010 native ClickUp sync.
