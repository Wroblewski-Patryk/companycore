# CompanyCore v1 Task Contracts

These task contracts turn the v1 audit into executable work. Each task must be
completed as its own small iteration and must update `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
`.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, and relevant docs when status changes.

## v1 Architecture Addendum: Workspace Ownership

CompanyCore v1 must include a workspace ownership boundary. Registration creates
an owner user and workspace atomically. Business data, API keys, integration
settings, and integration sync state must resolve to a workspace before writes
are accepted. This is not full enterprise multi-tenancy: no invitations,
billing, advanced RBAC, or organization admin UI are planned for v1.

## v1 Regression Guardrails

Every runtime task must preserve these rules:

- protected routes resolve `workspaceId`
- cross-workspace access fails closed
- integration secrets are not logged or returned
- external sync is idempotent per `(workspace_id, source, external_id)`
- schema changes use migrations
- significant state changes emit events
- API errors use stable, safe response codes
- tests include allowed and denied paths

## CCV1-001 Canonical Architecture And Deployment Docs Alignment

### Header
- ID: CCV1-001
- Title: Canonical architecture and deployment docs alignment
- Task Type: research
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: Audit findings from 2026-05-02
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-001
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Make the canonical architecture and operations documents reflect the actual
CompanyCore v1 backend-only architecture.

### Scope
- `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- `docs/architecture/architecture-source-of-truth.md`
- `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Compare current short-form docs in `docs/*.md` with canonical architecture
   and operations docs.
2. Replace active template placeholders with CompanyCore-specific truth.
3. Keep the approved v1 boundary: no GUI, API as access layer, PostgreSQL as
   source of truth, native ClickUp adapter as the first integration pattern,
   and n8n as optional orchestration.
4. Record deployment topology, private Postgres, public API, and required
   secrets.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Canonical architecture docs no longer describe placeholder systems.
- [x] Docs clearly state that CompanyCore v1 has no GUI.
- [x] Docs clearly state the
  `ClickUp API -> CompanyCore adapter -> DB -> event` flow.
- [x] Deployment contract lists backend, Postgres, volume, health check, and
  required secrets.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Docs are updated in English.
- [x] No runtime code changes are included.
- [x] Planning and project state remain synchronized.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Replaced canonical architecture and deployment placeholders
  with CompanyCore-specific backend-only architecture, workspace ownership,
  native ClickUp adapter direction, tech stack, and Coolify deployment contract.
- Files changed: `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`,
  `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`,
  `docs/architecture/architecture-source-of-truth.md`,
  `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Searched canonical docs for old template placeholder language,
  reviewed docs for the required architecture statements, and ran
  `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Runtime implementation is unchanged; CCV1-011 must still
  finalize detailed workspace/auth schema and auth-context contract.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-011.

## CCV1-002 Real Planning Queue And Task Contracts

### Header
- ID: CCV1-002

- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Planner
- Depends on: Audit findings from 2026-05-02
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-002
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Replace template planning placeholders with a real, dependency-aware
CompanyCore v1 execution queue.

### Scope
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/open-decisions.md`
- `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Convert audit findings into `NOW`, `NEXT`, and `PIPELINE` work.
2. Add task contracts for each planned v1 slice.
3. Record open decisions that block route, auth, and migration details.
4. Synchronize task board and project state.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] No placeholder `PRJ-001` planning rows remain in active planning files.
- [x] Every queued v1 task has title, description, files likely affected,
  acceptance criteria, and priority.
- [x] Open decisions are explicit and assigned to future tasks.
- [x] Current project state points to the next executable slice.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Planning docs are updated in English.
- [x] No runtime implementation is included.
- [x] `npm run build` is optional because this is docs-only; run it only if
  code is touched.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Replaced placeholder planning with the CCV1 execution queue,
  task contracts, open decisions, task board updates, and project-state handoff.
- Files changed: `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`,
  `docs/planning/open-decisions.md`,
  `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, and
  `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`.
- How tested: Searched active planning/context files for old placeholder task
  markers and reviewed the git diff. No runtime code changed.
- What is incomplete: Canonical architecture and operations docs still need
  CCV1-001.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-001.

- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-010
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Implement ClickUp as the first native CompanyCore integration adapter so Jarvis
and future AI agents can use CompanyCore directly without requiring separate
n8n workflows.

### Goal
Create the reusable integration pattern for external systems by adding a
minimal, production-shaped ClickUp adapter that can fetch ClickUp task data,
normalize it, persist it through existing CompanyCore models inside the active
workspace, and emit events.

### Scope
- `src/integrations/clickup/*`
- `src/modules/tasks/*`
- `src/modules/events/*`
- `src/config/env.ts`
- `prisma/schema.prisma` and migrations only if integration state tables are
  approved
- `.env.example`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`
- `docs/operations/service-reliability-and-observability.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Define the smallest approved v1 ClickUp scope from DEC-005 before coding.
2. Read ClickUp configuration from workspace integration settings, with only
   encryption/application secrets coming from environment variables.
3. Build a dedicated ClickUp client/adapter under `src/integrations/clickup`.
4. Normalize ClickUp tasks into the existing `Task` model with `source =
   clickup`, `externalId`, and the active `workspaceId`.
5. Reuse existing task upsert and event creation behavior where possible.
6. Add an authenticated endpoint or service command to trigger sync.
7. Record failure behavior, retry expectations, and observability notes.

### Files Likely Affected
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.client.ts`
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.mapper.ts`
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.sync.ts`

- workspace integration settings modules from CCV1-013
- `.env.example`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] CompanyCore can call the ClickUp API using workspace-owned credentials.
- [x] ClickUp tasks are normalized into CompanyCore tasks inside the active
  workspace.
- [x] Sync upserts by `(workspace_id, source = clickup, external_id)`.
- [x] Sync emits `task_synced_from_clickup`.
- [x] Integration failures return safe API errors and do not corrupt existing
  tasks.
- [x] ClickUp secrets are not logged, not returned by API responses, and are
  documented in integration/deployment docs.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Implemented the first native ClickUp pull-sync adapter with a
  provider client, mapper, sync service, protected trigger route, task
  workspace ownership, idempotent task upsert, and sync events.

- How tested: Reviewed official ClickUp API docs for task filtering, ran
  `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`, `npx prisma validate` with a local
  `DATABASE_URL`, and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Automated endpoint tests and real ClickUp production
  smoke remain in CCV1-006 and CCV1-009.

## CCV1-011 Workspace Ownership And Auth Architecture Contract

### Header
- ID: CCV1-011
- Title: Workspace ownership and auth architecture contract
- Task Type: research
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: CCV1-001
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-011
- Operation Mode: ARCHITECT

### Description
Define the v1 auth and workspace ownership model before runtime auth and
integration secrets are implemented.

### Goal
Make the workspace boundary explicit: registration creates an owner user and
workspace, business records are workspace-scoped, API keys are workspace-scoped
service credentials, and integration settings belong to the workspace.

### Files Likely Affected
- `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/architecture-source-of-truth.md`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`
- `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md`
- `docs/planning/open-decisions.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Docs define `users`, `workspaces`, and owner relationship.
- [x] Docs define whether v1 uses direct owner relation or membership rows.
- [x] Docs define which existing models require `workspace_id`.
- [x] Docs define auth context resolution for user sessions and API keys.
- [x] Docs define fail-closed behavior when workspace cannot be resolved.
- [x] Docs define how integration settings belong to workspaces.
- [x] No runtime code changes are included.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Finalized the v1 workspace/auth architecture contract:
  email/password owner auth with hashed password storage, automatic workspace
  creation, `workspace_memberships` with only `owner` active in v1, and
  workspace-scoped service API keys for agents/automations.
- Files changed: `docs/DATABASE.md`, `docs/API.md`,

  `docs/planning/open-decisions.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and
  this task contract.
- How tested: Reviewed docs for CCV1-011 acceptance criteria and ran
  `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Runtime schema/auth implementation remains in CCV1-012,
  CCV1-013, and CCV1-007.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-014 API contract and error response standard.

## CCV1-012 Registration, Login, And Workspace Bootstrap

### Header
- ID: CCV1-012
- Title: Registration, login, and workspace bootstrap
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-011, CCV1-003
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-012
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Implement owner registration and login so CompanyCore can create a workspace
automatically and authenticate future API or GUI clients.

### Goal
Provide the minimal auth runtime for v1: owner registration creates user and
workspace in one transaction; login returns an authenticated context; protected
business routes can resolve `userId` and `workspaceId`.

### Files Likely Affected
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `prisma/migrations/*`
- `src/auth/*`
- `src/modules/auth/*`
- `src/middleware/*`
- `src/app.ts`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `POST /auth/register` or approved equivalent creates owner user and
  workspace atomically.
- [x] Duplicate email/owner registration is handled safely.
- [x] `POST /auth/login` or approved equivalent authenticates the owner.
- [x] Passwords or login secrets are hashed; plaintext credentials are never
  stored.
- [x] Protected routes can resolve `workspaceId`.
- [x] `GET /health` remains public.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added owner registration/login, signed bearer auth tokens,
  password hashing, workspace and owner membership models, workspace-aware API
  key context, and local seed bootstrap for an owner workspace.
- Files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `prisma/migrations/202605022_workspace_auth/migration.sql`,
  `prisma/seed.ts`, `.env.example`, `src/app.ts`, `src/config/env.ts`,
  `src/auth/api-key.middleware.ts`, `src/auth/password.ts`,
  `src/auth/token.ts`, `src/modules/auth/auth.routes.ts`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Ran `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`,
  `npx prisma validate` with a local `DATABASE_URL`, and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Workspace scoping is available in auth context, but
  existing business routes still need filtering/persistence by workspace in
  later scoped tasks.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-013 workspace-scoped integration settings and secret
  storage.

## CCV1-013 Workspace-Scoped Integration Settings And Secret Storage

### Header
- ID: CCV1-013
- Title: Workspace-scoped integration settings and secret storage
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-011, CCV1-012, CCV1-003
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-013
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Add the storage and API contract for workspace-owned integration settings,
starting with ClickUp credentials and sync configuration.

### Goal
Store integration configuration under the workspace so ClickUp and future
integrations are not global process settings. Secrets must be protected,
non-leaking, and usable by native integration adapters.

### Files Likely Affected
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `prisma/migrations/*`
- `src/modules/integration-settings/*`
- `src/integrations/*`
- `src/config/env.ts`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Workspace can store ClickUp token/config through an authenticated route or
  approved bootstrap path.
- [x] Integration settings are tied to `workspaceId`.
- [x] Secret values are encrypted or otherwise protected according to the
  approved v1 security plan.
- [x] Secret values are never returned in API responses or logs.
- [x] Cross-workspace access is rejected.
- [x] ClickUp adapter contract reads settings through this workspace-scoped
  mechanism.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added workspace-owned integration settings, encrypted provider
  secret storage, ClickUp settings routes, and service helpers for native
  adapters to read decrypted workspace settings inside the backend process.
- Files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `prisma/migrations/202605023_integration_settings/migration.sql`,
  `.env.example`, `src/config/env.ts`, `src/app.ts`,
  `src/integrations/secrets.ts`,

  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Ran `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`,
  `npx prisma validate` with a local `DATABASE_URL`, and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Native ClickUp API calls and sync behavior remain in
  CCV1-010 after CCV1-017 defines the adapter observability contract.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-017 integration adapter contract and observability
  minimum, then implement CCV1-010 native ClickUp sync.
