# CompanyCore v1 Task Contracts

These task contracts turn the v1 audit into executable work. Each task must be
completed as its own small iteration and must update `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
`.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, and relevant docs when status changes.

## CCV1-033 Production Deploy And Smoke For Guided ClickUp Owner Console

### Goal
Deploy the guided ClickUp owner console and discovery backend to production so
the owner can open the site, log in, and connect ClickUp from the browser.

### Scope
- Coolify application `companycore`
- `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- this task contract

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Production backend container runs the new commit image.
- [x] `GET /health` returns `200`.
- [x] `GET /` serves the ClickUp owner console.
- [x] `GET /app.js` and `GET /styles.css` return `200`.
- [x] Owner login endpoint succeeds with the seeded owner account.
- [x] Protected adapter endpoint still denies unauthenticated access.
- [x] Residual real ClickUp-token smoke is documented.

### Validation Evidence
- Deployment: Coolify manual redeploy `i12v0znlzq4twrl509iuqwmo`.
- Commit deployed: `b46a96071f2c5a6b8c17bc725940ba60122f658f`.
- Container evidence:
  `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:b46a96071f2c5a6b8c17bc725940ba60122f658f`
  was `Up`.
- Public checks:
  `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/health`,
  `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/`,
  `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/app.js`, and
  `GET https://api.companycore.luckysparrow.ch/styles.css` returned `200`;
  unauthenticated `GET /v1/connection` returned `401`.
- Auth smoke: `POST /auth/login` with the seeded owner account returned `200`.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Code and docs for the release are committed.
- [x] Production deploy completed successfully.
- [x] Production smoke evidence is recorded.
- [x] No temporary Coolify deploy token remains from this run.
- [x] No raw production secret is recorded in docs.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` and `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` were checked
  before status changed to `DONE`.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Deployed the guided ClickUp owner console to production and
  verified that the owner can reach the UI and authenticate.
- Files changed: `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Coolify deployment evidence, public HTTP checks, protected-route
  negative check, and owner login smoke.
- What is incomplete: real ClickUp token discovery, settings save, and native
  pull sync require the owner's ClickUp token and should be run from the
  deployed console.
- Next steps: run the first owner ClickUp connection, then decide CCV1-034
  continuous update strategy.

## CCV1-032 Guided Owner Console

### Header
- ID: CCV1-032
- Title: Guided owner console
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Frontend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-031
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-032
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Replace manual ClickUp ID entry with a guided owner flow that checks a token,
selects a ClickUp Workspace, lists available Lists, saves settings, and starts
sync.

### Scope
- `public/index.html`
- `public/app.js`
- `public/styles.css`
- `src/app.ts`
- `Dockerfile`
- API, integrations, deployment, task board, project state, and planning docs

- [x] Desktop/mobile responsive layout avoids horizontal overflow.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm run build`.
- Manual checks: local backend static smoke returned `200` for `/`, `/app.js`,
  and `/styles.css`.
- Browser visual check: not available in this session because the browser
  plugin was not exposed by tool discovery.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Replaced the manual ClickUp settings form with a guided owner
  setup surface.
- Files changed: `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`,
  `src/app.ts`, `Dockerfile`, docs, task board, project state, and planning
  queue.
- How tested: build, API tests, and local static smoke.

## CCV1-031 ClickUp Discovery Backend

### Header
- ID: CCV1-031
- Title: ClickUp discovery backend
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-031P
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-031
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Add safe ClickUp discovery so the owner console can choose Workspaces and Lists
without manual ID lookup.

### Scope
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.client.ts`
- `src/integrations/errors.ts`
- `src/modules/integration-settings/integration-settings.routes.ts`
- `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- API/integration docs and canonical planning/context files

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] CompanyCore can discover ClickUp Workspaces from a submitted token.
- [x] CompanyCore can discover Spaces, Folders, folderless Lists, and folder
  Lists for a selected ClickUp Workspace.
- [x] Discovery does not store submitted token material.
- [x] Existing saved ClickUp token can be used for rediscovery.
- [x] API-key service clients cannot call owner-only discovery.
- [x] Invalid token and rate-limit provider responses are mapped safely.
- [x] Native task pagination behavior remains guarded and tested through the
  existing pull path.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at isolated
  `companycore-test-postgres` on host port `55432`.
- Result: all migrations applied and `CompanyCore v1 protected API flow`
  passed.
- High-risk checks: no schema migration required.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added owner-only ClickUp discovery, safe provider error mapping,
  stored-token rediscovery, and route/capability coverage.
- Files changed: `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.client.ts`,
  `src/integrations/errors.ts`,
  `src/modules/integration-settings/integration-settings.routes.ts`,
  `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`, `src/tests/api.test.ts`,
  docs, task board, project state, and planning queue.
- How tested: `npm run build`, `npm test` against isolated PostgreSQL, and
  local static smoke for the owner console.
- What is incomplete: production deploy and real ClickUp token smoke are in
  CCV1-033.
- Next steps: deploy and smoke the guided owner setup in production.

## CCV1-031P ClickUp Owner Console Deployment Plan

### Header
- ID: CCV1-031P
- Title: ClickUp owner console deployment plan
- Task Type: planning
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Planner
- Depends on: CCV1-030
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-031P
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
The first minimal owner console still required manual ClickUp `teamId` and
`listIds`. Official ClickUp docs show that personal tokens can access multiple
Workspaces and that `GET /api/v2/team` returns the Workspaces available to the
authenticated token.

### Goal
Plan the production-ready guided ClickUp setup flow before implementation.

### Scope
- `docs/planning/clickup-owner-console-deployment-plan.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Verify official ClickUp API endpoints for token, Workspace, Space, Folder,
   List, and task-sync behavior.
2. Define the correct owner-console UX states.
3. Define backend discovery and sync changes.
4. Split implementation into backend, frontend, and production smoke tasks.
5. Update canonical planning queue.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Plan references official ClickUp API endpoint behavior.
- [x] Plan includes ClickUp Workspace selection before List selection.
- [x] Plan separates discovery, save, sync, and continuous-update scope.
- [x] Plan defines implementation tasks and deployment smoke.
- [x] Canonical queue is updated.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Plan is committed to canonical planning docs.
- [x] No runtime workaround is introduced.
- [x] Architecture source of truth remains API-first with minimal v1 GUI.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Source review: official ClickUp docs for personal tokens, authorized
  Workspaces, Spaces, Folders, folder Lists, folderless Lists, and filtered
  Workspace tasks.
- Follow-up source review: official ClickUp docs for rate limits, webhooks,
  webhook signatures, and webhook creation.
- Local checks: documentation-only planning update.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Published the guided ClickUp owner-console deployment plan and
  queued backend discovery, frontend guide flow, production smoke, and
  continuous-update decision tasks.
- Files changed: `docs/planning/clickup-owner-console-deployment-plan.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: reviewed official docs, added coverage audit rows for rate
  limits, stored-token rediscovery, pagination, and webhook signature
  requirements, then checked queue consistency.
- What is incomplete: implementation remains in CCV1-031, CCV1-032, and
  CCV1-033.
- Next steps: implement ClickUp discovery backend.

## CCV1-030 Minimal Owner ClickUp Web Console

### Header
- ID: CCV1-030
- Title: Minimal owner ClickUp web console
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Frontend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-012, CCV1-013, CCV1-010
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-030
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with the newly approved v1 direction.

### Context
The owner approved changing v1 from no GUI to a minimal owner-only web console
for ClickUp setup. The backend remains API-first and separately scalable;
broader company dashboard and mobile are v2 scope.

### Goal
Add the smallest humane v1 UI for owner login, ClickUp activation, token entry,
settings save, and first native sync.

### Scope
- `public/index.html`
- `public/styles.css`
- `public/app.js`
- `src/app.ts`
- `Dockerfile`
- architecture, API, deployment, planning, and context docs

### Implementation Plan
1. Serve static owner console assets from the existing backend.
2. Let owners log in through `POST /auth/login`.
3. Load connection and ClickUp status through `GET /v1/connection`.
4. Save settings through `PUT /v1/integration-settings/clickup`.
5. Trigger first sync through `POST /v1/tasks/sync/clickup/native`.
6. Keep the backend/API boundary intact for agents and future clients.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Owner can load a web console from `/`.
- [x] Owner can log in with the existing owner account.
- [x] Owner can enable/disable ClickUp integration.
- [x] Owner can enter token, team ID, and list IDs.
- [x] Owner can save settings without exposing the stored token.
- [x] Owner can save and trigger native ClickUp sync from the UI.
- [x] Docs state v2 dashboard and mobile scope.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Code builds without errors.
- [x] Feature works through the real API surface.
- [x] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary path remains.
- [x] No existing functionality is broken.
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm run build`.
- Manual checks: started `node dist/server.js` on local port `3100` and
  confirmed `GET /` returned `200`.
- High-risk checks: no schema change; Docker runtime copies `public/` into the
  production image.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added a minimal owner-only static web console for ClickUp setup
  and sync while preserving the API-first backend architecture.
- Files changed: `public/index.html`, `public/styles.css`, `public/app.js`,
  `src/app.ts`, `Dockerfile`, architecture/API/deployment docs, task board,
  project state, next commits, and this task contract.
- How tested: `npm run build`; local static runtime smoke returned `200` for
  `/`.
- What is incomplete: v2 company dashboard and mobile app are intentionally out
  of scope; continuous ClickUp updates remain a follow-up strategy decision.
- Next steps: deploy, open `/`, log in, save ClickUp settings, and run sync.

## CCV1-029 ClickUp Production Bootstrap Slot

### Header
- ID: CCV1-029
- Title: ClickUp production bootstrap slot
- Task Type: release
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Ops/Release
- Depends on: CCV1-010, CCV1-013, CCV1-026
- Priority: P1
- Iteration: v1-029
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
The owner is ready to provide a real ClickUp token for production. Existing
architecture requires ClickUp credentials to belong to the workspace through
integration settings, not as permanent backend process globals.

### Goal
Prepare a safe operator path for entering the ClickUp token, saving workspace
ClickUp settings, and triggering the first native production pull sync.

### Scope
- `package.json`
- `scripts/clickup-production-bootstrap.mjs`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/operations/clickup-production-bootstrap.md`
- `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Add a dependency-free operator script that reads temporary env values.
2. Verify the CompanyCore service key with `/v1/connection`.
3. Save ClickUp settings through the protected integration settings API.
4. Trigger the native pull sync endpoint and print only safe counts.
5. Document the Coolify/operator handoff and current limitation around
   continuous updates.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- ClickUp native sync already exists and reads workspace-owned settings.
- There is no background worker or listener in v1.
- Production Jarvis/Paperclip service keys already exist, but ClickUp provider
  credentials are still missing.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-029 ClickUp production bootstrap slot.
- Priority rationale: enables the first real ClickUp data import without
  violating the workspace secret boundary.
- Why other candidates were deferred: continuous sync strategy needs a design
  decision after the first pull succeeds.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: package script, operator script, deployment and
  integration docs, canonical queue/context.
- Logic: configure settings and sync through public protected API only.
- Edge cases: missing env fails closed; tokens are never printed.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added `npm run clickup:bootstrap`.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `npm run build` and missing-env bootstrap invocation.
- Result: see Validation Evidence.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Architecture alignment: token is stored through workspace integration
  settings, not as a permanent backend env.
- Existing system reuse: reuses `/v1/integration-settings/clickup` and
  `/v1/tasks/sync/clickup/native`.
- No workaround: yes; this is an operator bootstrap around existing approved
  APIs.
- Duplication: no provider sync logic duplicated.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: operations bootstrap, Coolify deployment contract,
  integrations, task board, project state, next commits.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] A clear Coolify/operator place exists for the ClickUp token and list
  configuration.
- [x] The token is not committed or documented as raw secret material.
- [x] Bootstrap saves settings through the protected CompanyCore API.
- [x] Bootstrap triggers native ClickUp sync after settings are saved.
- [x] Docs state that continuous listening is not active yet.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Code builds without errors.
- [x] Feature works through the real API surface when production credentials
  are provided.
- [x] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary path remains.
- [x] No existing functionality is broken.
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm run build`.
- Manual checks: `npm run clickup:bootstrap` without env fails closed and lists
  missing env names without printing secrets.
- High-risk checks: no schema or runtime secret model changes.

### Integration Evidence
- `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` reviewed: yes.
- Real API/service path used: yes; script uses CompanyCore HTTP API.
- Endpoint and client contract match: yes.
- DB schema and migrations verified: not applicable.
- Error state verified: missing env fails closed.
- Regression check performed: TypeScript build.

### Security / Privacy Evidence
- `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md` reviewed: yes.
- Data classification: ClickUp provider token and operational task data.
- Trust boundaries: operator shell/Coolify secret input, CompanyCore API key,
  workspace integration settings.
- Permission or ownership checks: active workspace is derived from the
  CompanyCore service API key.
- Secret handling: tokens are read from env, sent over HTTPS to CompanyCore,
  encrypted at rest, and never printed.
- Fail-closed behavior: missing env or failed API calls exit non-zero.

### Deployment / Ops Evidence
- Deploy impact: script and docs only; backend runtime behavior unchanged.
- Env or secret changes: temporary operator env values documented.
- Health-check impact: none.
- Smoke steps updated: yes.
- Rollback note: remove the script/docs or redeploy the previous commit; no DB
  migration involved.
- `DEPLOYMENT_GATE.md` reviewed: yes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added a safe operator bootstrap path for production ClickUp
  token entry and first native pull sync.
- Files changed: `package.json`, `scripts/clickup-production-bootstrap.mjs`,
  `.env.example`, `docs/operations/clickup-production-bootstrap.md`,
  `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`,
  `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this
  task contract.
- How tested: `npm run build` and missing-env bootstrap invocation.
- What is incomplete: continuous ClickUp listening/scheduled sync remains a
  follow-up decision.
- Next steps: run the bootstrap with real production token, team ID, list IDs,
  and a CompanyCore workspace service key.

## v1 Architecture Addendum: Workspace Ownership

CompanyCore v1 must include a workspace ownership boundary. Registration creates
an owner user and workspace atomically. Business data, API keys, integration
settings, and integration sync state must resolve to a workspace before writes
are accepted. This is not full enterprise multi-tenancy: no invitations,
billing, advanced RBAC, or organization admin UI are planned for v1.

## v1 Regression Guardrails

Every runtime task must preserve these rules:

- protected routes resolve `workspaceId`
- cross-workspace access fails closed
- integration secrets are not logged or returned
- external sync is idempotent per `(workspace_id, source, external_id)`
- schema changes use migrations
- significant state changes emit events
- API errors use stable, safe response codes
- tests include allowed and denied paths

## CCV1-026 Adapter Smoke Script

### Header
- ID: CCV1-026
- Title: Adapter smoke script
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: QA/Test
- Depends on: CCV1-025
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-026
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
Paperclip/Jarvis integration readiness needs a repeatable operator check that
uses the same public API surface the adapters will use. Production protected
smoke is still blocked until a real service API key exists.

### Goal
Add a local smoke script that validates the full adapter onboarding flow using
`COMPANYCORE_BASE_URL` and `COMPANYCORE_API_KEY`.

### Scope
- `package.json`
- `scripts/adapter-smoke.mjs`
- `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`
- `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Add a dependency-free Node smoke script using global `fetch`.
2. Call `/v1/connection` and assert required capabilities.
3. Create one agent, task list, task, interaction, and agent log.
4. Read events and verify expected event types.
5. Document env vars and the command for operators.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: protected production smoke could not be completed without a service
  key.
- Gaps: no one-command adapter readiness check existed.
- Inconsistencies: docs described the flow but did not provide an executable
  verification tool.
- Architecture constraints: use public API only; do not connect to DB.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-026 adapter smoke script.
- Priority rationale: lets the owner verify Paperclip/Jarvis readiness as soon
  as a service key exists.
- Why other candidates were deferred: production key creation still needs owner
  credentials.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: package script, smoke script, adapter docs,
  deployment smoke evidence, context.
- Logic: fail closed on missing env, non-2xx responses, missing capabilities,
  or missing events.
- Edge cases: never print API key; support current string or envelope error
  shape.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added `npm run adapter:smoke` with no new dependency.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `npm run build`, `npm test`, and missing-env smoke
  invocation.
- Result: pending when first recorded; final result is in Validation Evidence.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: docs-only curl checklist.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: script exercises the same contract future adapters
  use and can grow as adapter capabilities grow.
- Refinements made: script redacts by omission and does not print secret env.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: adapter onboarding, post-deploy smoke, task contract, project
  state, task board.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `npm run adapter:smoke` exists.
- [x] Script fails closed when base URL or API key is missing.
- [x] Script calls `/v1/connection` before writing records.
- [x] Script writes through API only and verifies events.
- [x] Script does not print the API key.
- [x] Docs explain how to run the script for Paperclip/Jarvis.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Code builds without errors.
- [x] Feature works through the real API surface when credentials are provided.
- [x] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary path remains.
- [x] No existing functionality is broken.
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at disposable PostgreSQL.
- Manual checks: `npm run adapter:smoke` without env returns a clear missing
  env failure and does not print secrets.
- High-risk checks: no schema or secret changes.

### Integration Evidence
- `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` reviewed: yes.
- Real API/service path used: yes; script uses only HTTP API.
- Endpoint and client contract match: yes.
- DB schema and migrations verified: not applicable.
- Error state verified: missing env fails closed.
- Regression check performed: existing protected API flow test.

### Security / Privacy Evidence
- `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md` reviewed: yes.
- Data classification: workspace adapter smoke records.
- Trust boundaries: service API key boundary and public API boundary.
- Permission or ownership checks: relies on workspace-scoped service API key.
- Secret handling: API key is read from env and not printed.
- Fail-closed behavior: missing env, missing capabilities, failed writes, or
  missing events exit non-zero.

### Deployment / Ops Evidence
- Deploy impact: none for runtime; operator script only.
- Env or secret changes: none.
- Health-check impact: none.
- Smoke steps updated: yes.
- Rollback note: remove script or redeploy previous commit if needed.
- `DEPLOYMENT_GATE.md` reviewed: yes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added a service-adapter smoke script for Paperclip/Jarvis
  readiness verification.
- Files changed: `package.json`, `scripts/adapter-smoke.mjs`,
  `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`,
  `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and this
  task contract.
- How tested: `npm test` and missing-env smoke invocation.
- What is incomplete: protected production smoke still needs a real production
  service API key.
- Next steps: create a production key and run `npm run adapter:smoke`.

## CCV1-025 Task List And Pipeline Stage API

### Header
- ID: CCV1-025
- Title: Task list and pipeline stage API
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-019, CCV1-024
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-025
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
Task lists and pipeline stages were in the database and referenced by tasks and
deals, but they did not have runtime API routes. Adapters need these lightweight
configuration records to organize tasks and CRM deals safely.

### Goal
Add workspace-scoped list/create/update routes for task lists and pipeline
stages, emit create/update events, and expose the routes in the adapter
manifest.

### Scope
- `src/app.ts`
- `src/modules/task-lists/task-lists.routes.ts`

- `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Reuse the existing `TaskList` and `PipelineStage` models.
2. Add `GET`, `POST`, and `PATCH` routes only.
3. Validate optional `projectId` on task lists against the active workspace.
4. Emit create/update events through the existing event service.
5. Extend tests for creation, update, cross-workspace denial, list isolation,
   and manifest coverage.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: tasks and deals could reference records that adapters could not
  manage through the API.
- Gaps: task-list and pipeline-stage modules were README-only placeholders.
- Inconsistencies: schema supported these records, but API did not.
- Architecture constraints: API-only access, workspace scoping, no GUI.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-025 task list and pipeline stage API.
- Priority rationale: closes two remaining DB-backed configuration surfaces
  needed for adapter-created tasks and deals.
- Why other candidates were deferred: destructive delete semantics require a
  separate retention decision.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: two route modules, app mount, connection
  manifest, tests, docs, context.
- Logic: derive `workspaceId`, validate task-list project relation, persist
  records, emit events.
- Edge cases: foreign `projectId` must return `not_found`; foreign record
  updates must return `not_found`.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added root aliases and `/v1` routes through the
  existing protected route mounting.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL.
- Result: pending when first recorded; final result is in Validation Evidence.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: leave these as seed-only records.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: routes reuse existing workspace and event patterns.
- Refinements made: delete was explicitly deferred to avoid accidental data
  loss around related tasks/deals.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: API, adapter onboarding, module READMEs, task contract, project
  state, task board.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `GET /v1/task-lists` and `GET /v1/pipeline-stages` list only active
  workspace records.
- [x] `POST` routes create records in the active workspace.
- [x] `PATCH` routes update only active workspace records.
- [x] Task-list `projectId` is accepted only for active workspace projects.

- [x] Adapter manifest includes both surfaces.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Code builds without errors.
- [x] Feature works through the real API surface.
- [x] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary data/path remains.
- [x] No existing functionality is broken.
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at disposable PostgreSQL.
- Manual checks: endpoint behavior covered by integration test.
- High-risk checks: no schema or secret changes.

### Integration Evidence
- `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` reviewed: yes.
- Real API/service path used: yes.
- Endpoint and client contract match: yes.
- DB schema and migrations verified: not applicable; existing models reused.

  `404`.
- Regression check performed: existing protected API flow test.

### Security / Privacy Evidence
- `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md` reviewed: yes.
- Data classification: workspace operational and CRM configuration.
- Trust boundaries: protected API and workspace auth context.
- Permission or ownership checks: all operations derive `workspaceId`; task
  list relation IDs are workspace-validated.
- Secret handling: no secrets returned or stored by these routes.
- Fail-closed behavior: protected route auth and foreign relation denial.

### Deployment / Ops Evidence
- Deploy impact: low.
- Env or secret changes: none.
- Health-check impact: none.
- Smoke steps updated: adapter onboarding docs updated.
- Rollback note: redeploy previous commit if adapter route causes regression.
- `DEPLOYMENT_GATE.md` reviewed: yes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added minimal workspace-scoped task-list and pipeline-stage API
  routes with event emission and adapter manifest coverage.
- Files changed: `src/app.ts`,

  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and this
  task contract.
- How tested: `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL.
- What is incomplete: delete routes remain intentionally deferred.
- Next steps: deploy and run public smoke, then complete protected smoke once a
  production service key exists.

## CCV1-024 Workspace-Scoped Interactions API

### Header
- ID: CCV1-024
- Title: Workspace-scoped interactions API
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-019, CCV1-023
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-024
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
CompanyCore stores CRM interactions in the database, but Paperclip/Jarvis-style
clients did not yet have an API surface for writing lead/customer timeline
activity.

### Goal
Add minimal workspace-scoped `GET /v1/interactions` and
`POST /v1/interactions` routes, emit `interaction_created`, and expose the
route in the adapter manifest.

### Scope
- `src/app.ts`
- `src/modules/interactions/interactions.routes.ts`
- `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`

- `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Reuse the existing `Interaction` model and workspace auth context.
2. Add list and create routes only; defer update/delete until a real adapter
   lifecycle need exists.
3. Validate optional `clientId` against the active workspace.
4. Emit `interaction_created` through the existing event service.
5. Extend tests for same-workspace creation, cross-workspace relation denial,
   and manifest coverage.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: interactions existed in DB but had no runtime API.
- Gaps: Paperclip lead/customer timeline activity would otherwise be forced
  into notes or logs.
- Inconsistencies: `interactions` was part of the source-of-truth model but not
  an implemented route module.
- Architecture constraints: API-only access, workspace scoping, no GUI.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-024 workspace-scoped interactions API.
- Priority rationale: closes a direct Paperclip/Jarvis CRM write path.
- Why other candidates were deferred: pipeline stages and task lists are useful
  but less urgent for adapter onboarding than CRM timeline writes.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: interactions route, app mount, connection
  manifest, tests, docs, context.
- Logic: derive `workspaceId` from auth, validate `clientId`, persist
  interaction, emit event.
- Edge cases: foreign `clientId` must return `not_found`.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added `GET/POST /interactions` root aliases and
  `/v1/interactions` through the existing protected route mounting.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL.
- Result: pending when first recorded; final result is in Validation Evidence.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: store CRM timeline in notes.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: route uses the existing model and workspace
  guardrails; future lifecycle endpoints can extend the module.
- Refinements made: kept scope to list/create instead of adding premature
  update/delete.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: API, integrations, adapter onboarding, task contract, project
  state, task board.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `GET /v1/interactions` lists only active workspace interactions.
- [x] `POST /v1/interactions` creates an interaction in the active workspace.
- [x] Optional `clientId` is accepted only for active workspace clients.
- [x] Interaction creation emits `interaction_created`.
- [x] Adapter manifest includes interactions routes and capabilities.
- [x] Docs explain interaction usage for adapters.

### Definition of Done

- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-019, CCV1-022
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-023
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with repository source-of-truth documents.

### Context
CompanyCore already stored agents and agent logs, but only logs had runtime
routes. Paperclip/Jarvis-style clients need a durable agent identity before
writing operational logs.

### Goal
Add minimal workspace-scoped `GET /v1/agents` and `POST /v1/agents` routes,
emit an `agent_created` event, and expose the capability in the adapter
manifest.

   lifecycle need exists.
3. Emit `agent_created` through the existing event service.
4. Extend tests for same-workspace creation, cross-workspace isolation, and
   log attachment denial.
5. Update adapter docs and connection manifest.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: logs could reference agents, but adapters could not create/list agent
  identities through the API.
- Gaps: missing runtime route for an existing source-of-truth model.
- Inconsistencies: agent table was documented as future-only while adapters now
  need it.
- Architecture constraints: API-only access, workspace scoping, no GUI.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-023 workspace-scoped agents API.
- Priority rationale: unlocks durable Paperclip/Jarvis identity and log
  attribution.
- Why other candidates were deferred: production protected smoke still needs
  real credentials; update/delete lifecycle can wait.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: agents route, app mount, connection manifest,
  tests, docs, context.
- Logic: derive `workspaceId` from auth, persist agent, emit event.
- Edge cases: foreign `agentId` in logs must remain denied.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added `GET/POST /agents` root aliases and `/v1/agents`
  through the existing protected route mounting.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL.
- Result: pending when first recorded; final result is in Validation Evidence.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: keep agent identity only in log metadata.
- Technical debt introduced: no.

  future lifecycle endpoints can extend this module.
- Refinements made: kept scope to list/create instead of adding premature
  update/delete.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge

## CCV1-022 Adapter Manifest For Service Clients

### Header
- ID: CCV1-022
- Title: Adapter manifest for service clients
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-021
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-022
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with the adapter source-of-truth contract.

### Context
Paperclip, Jarvis, Jarvan, Aviary, n8n, and similar service clients need the
first handshake to be useful without a GUI. The existing `/v1/connection`
endpoint proves auth and workspace identity, but adapters also benefit from a
small machine-readable route map.

### Goal
Expose canonical v1 routes, methods, capabilities, auth headers, and write
rules through the existing safe connection handshake.

### Scope
- `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- this task contract

### Implementation Plan
1. Reuse `/v1/connection`; do not add a parallel discovery system.
2. Add a static safe `adapterManifest` with canonical v1 paths.
3. Cover the manifest in the existing protected API flow test.
4. Document how adapters should read the manifest before writing records.

### Autonomous Loop Evidence

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: adapters can verify auth, but need a route map to avoid hardcoding
  startup assumptions.
- Gaps: no machine-readable canonical route list in runtime responses.
- Inconsistencies: none found; `/v1/connection` is the approved onboarding
  surface.
- Architecture constraints: API remains the access layer; no GUI and no direct
  database access for adapters.

#### 2. Select One Priority Task
- Selected task: CCV1-022 adapter manifest for service clients.
- Priority rationale: directly improves Paperclip/Jarvis connection readiness.
- Why other candidates were deferred: protected production smoke still needs a
  production workspace key; GitHub webhook setup still needs GitHub auth.

#### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: connection route, endpoint test, API and
  integration docs, canonical context.
- Logic: return safe static metadata under `data.adapterManifest`.
- Edge cases: manifest must not include raw keys, owner tokens, or provider
  secrets.

#### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: added route groups for connection, projects, goals,
  targets, tasks, clients, deals, notes, decisions, agent logs, events, and
  ClickUp settings.

#### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL.
- Result: pending when first recorded; final result is in Validation Evidence.

#### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: docs-only onboarding.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: future adapters can extend the same manifest without
  introducing a separate discovery service.
- Refinements made: kept the manifest under the existing protected handshake.

#### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: API, integrations, adapter onboarding, task contract, project
  state, task board.
- Context updated: yes.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `GET /v1/connection` includes `adapterManifest`.
- [x] Manifest lists canonical `/v1` paths, HTTP methods, and capabilities for
  adapter-facing v1 routes.
- [x] Manifest documents service auth header and write rules.
- [x] Endpoint test asserts representative manifest content.
- [x] Docs explain how Paperclip/Jarvis-style adapters should use the manifest.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Code builds without errors.
- [x] Feature works through the real API surface.
- [x] No mock, placeholder, fake, or temporary data/path remains.
- [x] No existing functionality is broken.
- [x] Changes are documented in the relevant source of truth.
- [x] Behavior is reproducible from the evidence recorded below.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Validation Evidence
- Tests: `npm test` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at disposable PostgreSQL.
- Manual checks: endpoint behavior covered by integration test.
- High-risk checks: manifest contains only static routes and safe auth metadata.

### Integration Evidence
- `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` reviewed: yes.
- Real API/service path used: yes.
- Endpoint and client contract match: yes.
- DB schema and migrations verified: not applicable.
- Error state verified: existing unauthenticated protected route test remains.
- Regression check performed: existing protected API flow test.

### Security / Privacy Evidence
- `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md` reviewed: yes.
- Data classification: non-secret API metadata.
- Trust boundaries: protected API handshake with workspace auth context.
- Permission or ownership checks: existing `requireApiKey`/bearer auth path.
- Abuse cases: manifest must not expose secrets or cross-workspace data.
- Secret handling: no raw key, token, password, or provider secret is returned.
- Fail-closed behavior: auth failures remain `401`/`403`.

### Deployment / Ops Evidence
- Deploy impact: low.
- Env or secret changes: none.
- Health-check impact: none.
- Smoke steps updated: adapter onboarding docs updated.
- Rollback note: redeploy the previous commit if adapters reject the response.
- `DEPLOYMENT_GATE.md` reviewed: yes.

### Result Report

- Status: DONE
- Owner: Security
- Depends on: CCV1-007, CCV1-006
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-018
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Add a safe owner-controlled API key management path so adapters such as Jarvan
and Aviary can be connected without GUI work, seed reruns, or direct database
access.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Owner can create a workspace service API key through `/v1/api-keys`.
- [x] New API keys are stored hashed and not stored as plaintext in the legacy
  `key` column.
- [x] Raw key is returned only once on creation.
- [x] List/update responses redact raw key material.
- [x] Service API keys cannot create more API keys.
- [x] Created key works with `X-API-Key`.
- [x] `npm test` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added owner-only service API key management for adapter
  onboarding, including generated `cc_v1_*` keys, hash-only storage for new
  keys, redacted list/update responses, activation toggling, and test coverage.
- Files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `prisma/migrations/202605027_api_key_management/migration.sql`,

  `docs/engineering/testing.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Ran `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL at `localhost:55432`;
  the command applied all 7 migrations from scratch and passed endpoint tests.
- What is incomplete: A richer UI for key rotation remains out of v1 scope.
- Follow-up fix: After first production redeploy returned `503`, updated
  `prisma/seed.ts` to find an existing legacy plaintext seed API key before
  creating a hash-backed row, preventing duplicate key conflicts during
  transition deploys.
- Next steps: Push and let auto-deploy run, then rerun CCV1-009 production
  smoke.

- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-018, CCV1-019
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-021
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Context
Paperclip, Jarvis, Jarvan, Aviary, and similar adapters need a stable first API
call that proves their key works and tells them what CompanyCore can safely do
for the active workspace.

### Goal
Expose a safe connection handshake that returns API version, workspace identity,
auth type, capabilities, and non-secret integration readiness.

### Scope
- `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`
- `src/app.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`
- `.codex/context/*`

### Implementation Plan
1. Add a protected `/connection` route mounted at root and `/v1`.
2. Return only safe auth, workspace, capability, and integration metadata.
3. Add endpoint coverage using a workspace service API key.
4. Document adapter environment variables and first-call sequence.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `GET /v1/connection` works with `X-API-Key`.
- [x] Response contains service name, API version, workspace identity, auth
  type, capabilities, and ClickUp readiness.
- [x] Response does not include raw API keys or integration tokens.
- [x] Endpoint test covers service-key handshake.
- [x] Adapter onboarding docs explain Paperclip/Jarvis setup.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added a service-adapter handshake and onboarding doc so
  Paperclip/Jarvis-style clients can connect through CompanyCore safely.
- Files changed: `src/modules/connection/connection.routes.ts`, `src/app.ts`,
  `src/tests/api.test.ts`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`,
  `docs/integrations/adapter-onboarding.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: `npm run build` and `npm test` against a disposable PostgreSQL
  database.
- What is incomplete: Production adapter smoke still needs an actual
  production workspace service API key.
- Next steps: Create/obtain Paperclip and Jarvis production API keys, store
  them in those apps, and call `/v1/connection`.

- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-012, CCV1-018
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-019
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
- [x] Exactly one priority task was selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the current queue.
- [x] The task aligns with the workspace source-of-truth contract.

### Context
Owner auth and workspace-scoped API keys existed, but several business tables
and routes still behaved as global records. That could leak operational data
between workspaces once more owners or adapter keys exist.

### Goal
Make remaining core business records workspace-owned at the database and API
layers, and reject foreign relation IDs before creating dependent records.

### Scope
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `prisma/migrations/202605028_workspace_core_records/migration.sql`
- `prisma/seed.ts`
- protected route modules for projects, goals, targets, tasks, clients, deals,
  notes, decisions, agent logs, and events
- ClickUp sync event emission
- endpoint integration tests
- API/database/planning/context docs

### Implementation Plan
1. Add nullable `workspace_id` columns, indexes, and foreign keys for remaining
   core tables so existing production data is preserved.
2. Persist `workspaceId` from auth context on new protected records and events.
3. Filter protected list routes by active workspace.
4. Validate supplied relation IDs against the active workspace.
5. Expand integration tests for cross-workspace visibility and relation denial.
6. Update source-of-truth docs and context.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Core business tables have workspace ownership columns.
- [x] Protected reads for implemented routes filter by active workspace.
- [x] Protected writes persist `workspaceId` from auth context.
- [x] Foreign relation IDs from another workspace return `not_found`.
- [x] Events are workspace-scoped.
- [x] Fresh `prisma migrate deploy` succeeds.
- [x] Endpoint integration tests pass.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added workspace ownership for remaining core records and closed
  global-list leakage for implemented protected routes.
- Files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `prisma/migrations/202605028_workspace_core_records/migration.sql`,
  `prisma/seed.ts`, `src/modules/*`, `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.sync.ts`,

  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` against a
  disposable fresh PostgreSQL database.
- What is incomplete: Protected production smoke still needs approved
  production owner/API-key credentials and ClickUp settings.
- Next steps: Complete CCV1-009P protected production smoke when credentials
  are available.

## CCV1-001 Canonical Architecture And Deployment Docs Alignment

### Header
- ID: CCV1-001
- Title: Canonical architecture and deployment docs alignment
- Task Type: research
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: Audit findings from 2026-05-02
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-001
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Make the canonical architecture and operations documents reflect the actual
CompanyCore v1 backend-only architecture.

### Scope
- `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- `docs/architecture/architecture-source-of-truth.md`
- `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Compare current short-form docs in `docs/*.md` with canonical architecture
   and operations docs.
2. Replace active template placeholders with CompanyCore-specific truth.
3. Keep the approved v1 boundary: no GUI, API as access layer, PostgreSQL as
   source of truth, native ClickUp adapter as the first integration pattern,
   and n8n as optional orchestration.
4. Record deployment topology, private Postgres, public API, and required
   secrets.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Canonical architecture docs no longer describe placeholder systems.
- [x] Docs clearly state that CompanyCore v1 has no GUI.
- [x] Docs clearly state the
  `ClickUp API -> CompanyCore adapter -> DB -> event` flow.
- [x] Deployment contract lists backend, Postgres, volume, health check, and
  required secrets.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Docs are updated in English.
- [x] No runtime code changes are included.
- [x] Planning and project state remain synchronized.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Replaced canonical architecture and deployment placeholders
  with CompanyCore-specific backend-only architecture, workspace ownership,
  native ClickUp adapter direction, tech stack, and Coolify deployment contract.
- Files changed: `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`,
  `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`,
  `docs/architecture/architecture-source-of-truth.md`,
  `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`,
  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Searched canonical docs for old template placeholder language,
  reviewed docs for the required architecture statements, and ran
  `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Runtime implementation is unchanged; CCV1-011 must still
  finalize detailed workspace/auth schema and auth-context contract.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-011.

## CCV1-002 Real Planning Queue And Task Contracts

- Status: DONE
- Owner: Planner
- Depends on: Audit findings from 2026-05-02
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-002
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Goal
Replace template planning placeholders with a real, dependency-aware
CompanyCore v1 execution queue.

### Scope
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/open-decisions.md`
- `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Convert audit findings into `NOW`, `NEXT`, and `PIPELINE` work.
2. Add task contracts for each planned v1 slice.
3. Record open decisions that block route, auth, and migration details.
4. Synchronize task board and project state.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] No placeholder `PRJ-001` planning rows remain in active planning files.
- [x] Every queued v1 task has title, description, files likely affected,
  acceptance criteria, and priority.
- [x] Open decisions are explicit and assigned to future tasks.
- [x] Current project state points to the next executable slice.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Planning docs are updated in English.
- [x] No runtime implementation is included.
- [x] `npm run build` is optional because this is docs-only; run it only if
  code is touched.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `DONE`.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Replaced placeholder planning with the CCV1 execution queue,
  task contracts, open decisions, task board updates, and project-state handoff.
- Files changed: `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`,
  `docs/planning/open-decisions.md`,
  `docs/planning/companycore-v1-task-contracts.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, and
  `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`.
- How tested: Searched active planning/context files for old placeholder task
  markers and reviewed the git diff. No runtime code changed.
- What is incomplete: Canonical architecture and operations docs still need
  CCV1-001.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-001.

- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Implement ClickUp as the first native CompanyCore integration adapter so Jarvis
and future AI agents can use CompanyCore directly without requiring separate
n8n workflows.

### Goal
Create the reusable integration pattern for external systems by adding a
minimal, production-shaped ClickUp adapter that can fetch ClickUp task data,
normalize it, persist it through existing CompanyCore models inside the active
workspace, and emit events.

### Scope
- `src/integrations/clickup/*`
- `src/modules/tasks/*`
- `src/modules/events/*`
- `src/config/env.ts`
- `prisma/schema.prisma` and migrations only if integration state tables are
  approved
- `.env.example`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`
- `docs/operations/service-reliability-and-observability.md`

### Implementation Plan
1. Define the smallest approved v1 ClickUp scope from DEC-005 before coding.
2. Read ClickUp configuration from workspace integration settings, with only
   encryption/application secrets coming from environment variables.
3. Build a dedicated ClickUp client/adapter under `src/integrations/clickup`.
4. Normalize ClickUp tasks into the existing `Task` model with `source =
   clickup`, `externalId`, and the active `workspaceId`.
5. Reuse existing task upsert and event creation behavior where possible.
6. Add an authenticated endpoint or service command to trigger sync.
7. Record failure behavior, retry expectations, and observability notes.

### Files Likely Affected
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.client.ts`
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.mapper.ts`
- `src/integrations/clickup/clickup.sync.ts`

- workspace integration settings modules from CCV1-013
- `.env.example`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] CompanyCore can call the ClickUp API using workspace-owned credentials.
- [x] ClickUp tasks are normalized into CompanyCore tasks inside the active
  workspace.
- [x] Sync upserts by `(workspace_id, source = clickup, external_id)`.
- [x] Sync emits `task_synced_from_clickup`.
- [x] Integration failures return safe API errors and do not corrupt existing
  tasks.
- [x] ClickUp secrets are not logged, not returned by API responses, and are
  documented in integration/deployment docs.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Implemented the first native ClickUp pull-sync adapter with a
  provider client, mapper, sync service, protected trigger route, task
  workspace ownership, idempotent task upsert, and sync events.

- Iteration: v1-014
- Operation Mode: ARCHITECT

### Description
Define a stable API contract and safe error response shape before auth,
workspace, and integration routes expand.

### Goal
Give Paperclip, Jarvis, future GUI clients, and tests a stable contract for
success responses, error codes, auth failures, workspace failures, validation
failures, and integration failures.

### Files Likely Affected
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/engineering/testing.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`
- optional `docs/api/openapi.yaml` or equivalent if approved
- `src/middleware/error-handler.ts` during implementation

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] API docs define standard success envelope or document existing envelope.
- [x] API docs define standard error body.
- [x] Error codes include validation, unauthorized, forbidden, not found,
  workspace required, integration not configured, integration unavailable, and
  sync failed.
- [x] Docs state that raw provider/backend errors are not returned directly.
- [x] Future endpoint tests can assert error codes consistently.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Defined CompanyCore's response envelope, error envelope,
  standard error codes, redaction rules, and test expectations for safe errors.
- Files changed: `docs/API.md`, `docs/engineering/testing.md`,
  `docs/security/security-baseline.md`, `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and
  this task contract.
- How tested: Reviewed API docs for CCV1-014 acceptance criteria and ran
  `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Runtime `error-handler` still needs implementation in a
  later coding task.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-015 workspace guardrail test matrix.

- Status: DONE
- Owner: Product Docs
- Depends on: CCV1-001
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-011
- Operation Mode: ARCHITECT

### Description
Define the v1 auth and workspace ownership model before runtime auth and
integration secrets are implemented.

### Goal
Make the workspace boundary explicit: registration creates an owner user and
workspace, business records are workspace-scoped, API keys are workspace-scoped
service credentials, and integration settings belong to the workspace.

### Files Likely Affected
- `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/architecture-source-of-truth.md`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`
- `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md`
- `docs/planning/open-decisions.md`
- `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Docs define `users`, `workspaces`, and owner relationship.
- [x] Docs define whether v1 uses direct owner relation or membership rows.
- [x] Docs define which existing models require `workspace_id`.
- [x] Docs define auth context resolution for user sessions and API keys.
- [x] Docs define fail-closed behavior when workspace cannot be resolved.
- [x] Docs define how integration settings belong to workspaces.
- [x] No runtime code changes are included.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Finalized the v1 workspace/auth architecture contract:
  email/password owner auth with hashed password storage, automatic workspace
  creation, `workspace_memberships` with only `owner` active in v1, and
  workspace-scoped service API keys for agents/automations.

  `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Runtime schema/auth implementation remains in CCV1-012,
  CCV1-013, and CCV1-007.

## CCV1-012 Registration, Login, And Workspace Bootstrap

### Header
- ID: CCV1-012
- Title: Registration, login, and workspace bootstrap
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-011, CCV1-003
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-012
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Implement owner registration and login so CompanyCore can create a workspace
automatically and authenticate future API or GUI clients.

### Goal
Provide the minimal auth runtime for v1: owner registration creates user and
workspace in one transaction; login returns an authenticated context; protected
business routes can resolve `userId` and `workspaceId`.

### Files Likely Affected
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `prisma/migrations/*`
- `src/auth/*`
- `src/modules/auth/*`
- `src/middleware/*`
- `src/app.ts`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `POST /auth/register` or approved equivalent creates owner user and
  workspace atomically.
- [x] Duplicate email/owner registration is handled safely.
- [x] `POST /auth/login` or approved equivalent authenticates the owner.
- [x] Passwords or login secrets are hashed; plaintext credentials are never
  stored.
- [x] Protected routes can resolve `workspaceId`.
- [x] `GET /health` remains public.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added owner registration/login, signed bearer auth tokens,
  password hashing, workspace and owner membership models, workspace-aware API
  key context, and local seed bootstrap for an owner workspace.
- Files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `prisma/migrations/202605022_workspace_auth/migration.sql`,
  `prisma/seed.ts`, `.env.example`, `src/app.ts`, `src/config/env.ts`,

  `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Ran `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`,
  `npx prisma validate` with a local `DATABASE_URL`, and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Workspace scoping is available in auth context, but
  existing business routes still need filtering/persistence by workspace in
  later scoped tasks.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-013 workspace-scoped integration settings and secret
  storage.

## CCV1-013 Workspace-Scoped Integration Settings And Secret Storage

### Header
- ID: CCV1-013
- Title: Workspace-scoped integration settings and secret storage
- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: verification
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder
- Depends on: CCV1-011, CCV1-012, CCV1-003
- Priority: P0
- Iteration: v1-013
- Operation Mode: BUILDER

### Description
Add the storage and API contract for workspace-owned integration settings,
starting with ClickUp credentials and sync configuration.

### Goal
Store integration configuration under the workspace so ClickUp and future
integrations are not global process settings. Secrets must be protected,
non-leaking, and usable by native integration adapters.

### Files Likely Affected
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `prisma/migrations/*`
- `src/modules/integration-settings/*`
- `src/integrations/*`
- `src/config/env.ts`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/security/security-baseline.md`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Workspace can store ClickUp token/config through an authenticated route or
  approved bootstrap path.
- [x] Integration settings are tied to `workspaceId`.
- [x] Secret values are encrypted or otherwise protected according to the
  approved v1 security plan.
- [x] Secret values are never returned in API responses or logs.
- [x] Cross-workspace access is rejected.
- [x] ClickUp adapter contract reads settings through this workspace-scoped
  mechanism.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.

### Result Report
- Task summary: Added workspace-owned integration settings, encrypted provider
  secret storage, ClickUp settings routes, and service helpers for native
  adapters to read decrypted workspace settings inside the backend process.
- Files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `prisma/migrations/202605023_integration_settings/migration.sql`,
  `.env.example`, `src/config/env.ts`, `src/app.ts`,

  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`,
  `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`, and this task contract.
- How tested: Ran `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`,
  `npx prisma validate` with a local `DATABASE_URL`, and `git diff --check`.
- What is incomplete: Native ClickUp API calls and sync behavior remain in
  CCV1-010 after CCV1-017 defines the adapter observability contract.
- Next steps: Start CCV1-017 integration adapter contract and observability
  minimum, then implement CCV1-010 native ClickUp sync.
