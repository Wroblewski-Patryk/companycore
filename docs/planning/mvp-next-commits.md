# MVP Next Commits

Keep this file short and execution-focused. The active queue must stay
synchronized with `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`.

## NOW

- [ ] CCV1-007 API key hardening plan and implementation

## NEXT

- [ ] CCV1-006 Endpoint test foundation
- [ ] CCV1-008 Missing module route decision and minimal route slice

## PIPELINE

- [ ] CCV1-009 Production deployment verification

## GROUP QUEUE

- [ ] CCV1-A (docs and planning): CCV1-001, CCV1-002, CCV1-005
- [ ] CCV1-B (workspace and auth): CCV1-011, CCV1-012, CCV1-013, CCV1-007
- [ ] CCV1-C (regression prevention): CCV1-014, CCV1-015, CCV1-016, CCV1-017
- [ ] CCV1-D (runtime foundation): CCV1-003, CCV1-004, CCV1-006, CCV1-010
- [ ] CCV1-E (completion): CCV1-008, CCV1-009

## Refill Rules

- Keep `NOW` small. Recommended maximum: 3 tasks.
- Move tasks from `NEXT` to `NOW` only when the current active slot is free.
- Use `PIPELINE` only when a larger execution wave needs continuity beyond
  `NEXT`.
- Use `GROUP QUEUE` when the project executes larger waves as grouped batches
  with explicit commit ranges.
- Keep this file synchronized with `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`.
- When publishing a new execution plan, activate the first executable tasks in
  `NOW` and `NEXT` in the same turn.
- Before reporting that no work is queued, verify both:
  - active canonical queue sections
  - background or historical unchecked checklists outside the canonical queue,
    clearly labeled as non-active if found.
