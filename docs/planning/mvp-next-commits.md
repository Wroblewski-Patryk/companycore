# MVP Next Commits

Keep this file short and execution-focused. The active queue must stay
synchronized with `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`.

## Active Queue

### NOW

- [ ] ACF-DOC-001 Coverage Ledger Reconciliation:
      sync stale Drive/import and application-completion audit rows across
      active ledgers and source-of-truth files.

### NEXT

- [ ] ACF-PROD-001 Operating Model Data Completion Decision:
      decide whether empty production projects, storage locations, knowledge
      roots, and automation definitions need seed/import work or explicit
      accepted deferral.

### BLOCKED

- [ ] AGRUN-010 Upstream Agent Source Merge Execution:
      blocked until upstream write access or an approved fork/PR route exists.
- [ ] KI-002 GitHub-to-Coolify Auto-Deploy Proof:
      blocked until deploy automation evidence can be produced with approved
      provider or VPS access.

## Historical Completed Queue

The section below is retained as execution evidence. It is not the active
queue. Future work must start from `Active Queue`, `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`,
and `docs/operations/v1-function-coverage-ledger.csv`.

- [x] ACF-SEC-001 Production Secret And CORS Hardening:
      production now fails closed when required secret env vars are absent or
      still use committed development placeholder values; production CORS is
      restricted to `COMPANYCORE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` or the documented
      CompanyCore web/API domains. `npm test` passed against disposable
      PostgreSQL on `localhost:55452`.
- [x] ACF-UX-001 Mobile Overflow And Focus Accessibility Fix:
      `/settings/api` and `/react-company-os` passed signed-in desktop/mobile
      Playwright fallback checks with `horizontalOverflow=false`,
      `unnamedFocusableCount=0`, no console warnings/errors, and no relevant
      failed requests; `npm test` passed against disposable PostgreSQL on
      `localhost:55451`.
- [x] AGRUN-007 Google Drive Owner Consent And First Import:
      production runs `c5878d95a47f17745f65689c08e9e317a6465777`; OAuth is
      active; discovery found 172 folders; 13 numbered department root folders
      (`00`-`12`) were selected, imported, and mapped to operating areas;
      readback returned 748 imported Drive items, 171 folders,
      `unassignedCount=0`, and descendant scope verification
      `mismatches=[]`.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-015 Workflow Archive And Rollback Command Decision:
      selected phased recovery commands. Archive should first support inactive
      historical workflow versions by explicit root type/root ID; rollback
      should first create a rollback draft that flows through existing preview
      and activation.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-016 Workflow Historical Version Archive Backend Slice:
      added the first workflow recovery command for inactive historical root
      versions, with active-version and active-runtime-dependency blocking,
      idempotent replay, audit/event evidence, read-only denial, and MCP
      manifest metadata. `npm test` passed on disposable PostgreSQL
      `localhost:55439`.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-017 Workflow Rollback Draft Backend Slice:
      added rollback-draft creation from historical workflow roots without
      direct rollback execution. The route generates impact preview, records
      rollback source metadata in the draft change set, emits audit/event
      evidence, denies read-only sessions, and is idempotent. `npm test`
      passed on disposable PostgreSQL `localhost:55440`.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-018 Workflow Recovery Controls Web Decision:
      selected a dedicated `Recovery controls` panel inside the existing
      workflow command surface, keeping recovery separate from normal draft
      creation.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-019 Workflow Recovery Controls Web Surface:
      added route-kit clients and `/react-company-os` recovery controls for
      archive and rollback-draft commands. `npm run build` passed; `npm test`
      passed on disposable PostgreSQL `localhost:55441`; Playwright proof
      verified rollback-draft interaction on `http://127.0.0.1:3103`.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-020 Workflow Version Lineage Decision:
      decided that rollback across renamed workflow versions requires explicit
      root lineage rather than name matching.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-021 Workflow Version Lineage Implementation:
      added `family_id` lineage to process, pipeline, and procedure roots,
      copied it during activation, and resolved rollback-draft active targets
      by family. `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` passed
      against disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55442`.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-022 Company OS Collection Fetch Alignment:
      changed shared table-record path resolution so Company OS collection
      slugs use `/v1/company-os/:collection` instead of generic `/v1/:slug`.
      `npm run build` passed; Playwright mock render proof verified
      `/react-company-os` with `badGeneric=[]`, `notFound=[]`, and
      `consoleErrors=[]`.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-023 Workflow Recovery End-To-End Activation Proof:
      added an inline audited approval decision action to the workflow command
      panel and kept local recovery state intact until activation. `npm run
      build` passed; Playwright proof verified rollback draft, preview,
      approval request, approval decision, and activation with calls
      `rollback-draft`, `preview`, `request-approval`, `approve`, and
      `activate:approval-recovery-1`.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-024 Workflow Recovery Real Backend Proof:
      repeated the rollback recovery journey against a disposable Docker
      Compose backend on `http://127.0.0.1:3104`. The proof used a migrated and
      seeded PostgreSQL stack, created a historical version setup, then used
      `/react-company-os` for rollback draft, preview, approval request,
      approval decision, and activation. Console errors were `[]`; screenshot:
      `C:\Users\wrobl\AppData\Local\Temp\companycore-v2web024-real-backend-recovery-proof.png`.

- [x] V2PLAN-001 V2 Product Lane Selection:
      selected Agent-First Company OS as the next deliberate V2 lane after
      V1EVID-001 and V1EVID-002 closed local V1 evidence gaps. Updated
      `.agents/state/delivery-map.md` and canonical queues so the next task is
      an MCP/HTTP command-surface audit, not broad feature work.
- [x] V2AGENT-001 Agent-First Company OS MCP Command Surface Audit:
      published `docs/operations/v2-agent-company-os-command-surface-audit.md`,
      mapping existing Company OS lifecycle commands to MCP exposure,
      capabilities, evidence, and risks. The audit found
      `mcp_company_os_reader` has approval write scopes despite being
      documented as read-only, so V2AGENT-002 is the next safe slice.
- [x] V2AGENT-002 MCP Company OS Reader Least-Privilege Correction:
      removed approval write scopes from `mcp_company_os_reader` and added
      regression assertions that profile-created reader keys omit approval,
      stage, and automation write tools from the MCP manifest and receive
      `403` for approval request/decision calls. `npm run build` and Docker
      `node --test dist/tests/api.test.js` passed.
- [x] V2AGENT-003 Approval-Aware MCP Command Flow Design:
      added `docs/operations/approval-aware-mcp-command-flow.md`, defining
      fail-closed default bridge behavior for `requiresApproval` tools,
      supervised-only execution mode, evidence requirements, and V2AGENT-004
      as the next implementation slice.
- [x] V2AGENT-004 MCP Requires-Approval Bridge Guard:
      added the default fail-closed guard in
      `scripts/companycore-mcp-server.mjs`, extended the MCP smoke harness for
      expected blocked calls, and verified safe-read pass plus
      `mcp_tool_requires_supervision` blocked risky-tool behavior in the Docker
      API test gate.
- [x] V2AGENT-005 Supervised Operator MCP Smoke Harness:
      extended `scripts/companycore-mcp-smoke.mjs` with expected HTTP status
      and response-error checks, then added Docker API evidence that an
      `mcp_operator` key still gets `mcp_tool_requires_supervision` by default
      and only reaches HTTP validation when
      `COMPANYCORE_MCP_COMMAND_MODE=supervised_operator` is explicit.
- [x] V2AGENT-006 Agent Command Queue Cockpit Slice:
      added an agent command queue to `/react-company-os` from already-loaded
      approvals, stage runs, automation rules, and policies. `npm run build`
      passed; V2AGENT-006R closed rendered proof.
- [x] V2AGENT-006R Agent Command Queue Render Proof:
      verified `/react-company-os` with a temporary static SPA server, mock
      `/v1` Company OS endpoints, injected owner session, and system Chrome
      `--headless=new --dump-dom --virtual-time-budget=5000`.
- [x] V2WEB-ARCH-001 Human-Agent Web Architecture Map:
      added `docs/planning/human-agent-web-architecture-map.md`, mapping the
      approved Company OS and MCP architecture into web responsibilities and
      selecting Agent Tool Surface Workbench as the first human-agent UI
      bridge.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-001 Agent Tool Surface Workbench:
      added `/react-agent-tools`, typed MCP manifest loading, route-family
      grouping, risk/supervision badges, guardrails, and current
      auth/transport context using existing `/v1/connection` and
      `/v1/mcp/manifest`. `npm run build` and Browser plugin render/filter
      proof passed.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-002 Company OS Correlation Timeline:
      added a client-composed correlation timeline to `/react-company-os`
      using existing recent event and audit log `correlationId` data from
      `/v1/company-os`. `npm run build` and Playwright fallback render proof
      passed.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-003 Operating Graph Detail:
      added an operating graph detail panel to `/react-company-os`, connecting
      selected operating-area tables, provider table paths, Company OS
      resources, policies, risks, automation rules, recent runs, and
      correlation evidence from existing read contracts. `npm run build` and
      Playwright render proof passed.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-004 Workflow-Grade Command Panels:
      added approval, stage lifecycle, and automation command preview cards
      with prerequisites, expected result, recovery guidance, and automation
      proposal/effect evidence. Fixed automation dry-run result visibility.
      `npm run build` and Playwright render/interaction proof passed.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-005 Definition Editing Contract Decision:
      added `docs/architecture/company-os-definition-editing-contract.md`,
      classifying which Company OS definition objects can use scoped CRUD,
      command routes, versioning, approval, or no raw editing. The first
      allowed editor path is a low-risk Class A object such as `standards` or
      `company_roles`, after audited backend write routes exist.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-006 Class A Definition Editor Backend Contract:
      added `company-os:definition:write`, audited
      `POST/PATCH/DELETE /v1/company-os/standards`, soft archive status for
      standards, MCP manifest exposure with destructive archive supervision,
      and integration coverage for owner success, cross-workspace denial,
      read-only scoped denial, audit/event evidence, and manifest metadata.
      `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` against a
      disposable PostgreSQL database passed.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-007 Standards Definition Editor Web Surface:
      implemented the narrow `/react-company-os` standards editor using the
      audited backend routes, local capability-denied/save/archive notices,
      standard relation reads, and generated React bundle output. `npm run
      build`, static marker checks, and `git diff --check` passed.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-007R Standards Editor Render Proof:
      Playwright Chromium proof rendered `/react-company-os`, verified
      `Definition editor`, `Audited Class A editor`, `Proof Standard`,
      `Create standard`, `Standard created`, and `Render Proof Standard`,
      confirmed mocked `POST /v1/company-os/standards`, and reported zero
      relevant browser console issues with cleanup checks passing.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-008 Versioned Workflow Definition Command Contract:
      added
      `docs/architecture/company-os-workflow-definition-command-contract.md`,
      defining workflow draft/update, impact preview, approval, activation,
      archive, rollback, versioning, runtime evidence preservation, MCP
      exposure, and web-editor gates before any process/pipeline/procedure
      editor can ship.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-009 Workflow Definition Draft Backend Contract:
      added migration `202605142_workflow_definition_drafts`,
      `company-os:workflow-definition:write`, audited draft create/update and
      impact-preview routes, MCP manifest exposure, API/database docs, and
      integration coverage for owner success, idempotency, cross-workspace
      denial, read-only denial, audit/event evidence, and manifest metadata.
      `npm run build` and `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL on
      `localhost:55433` passed; the disposable container was removed.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-010 Workflow Definition Activation Backend Contract:
      added supervised activation route
      `POST /v1/company-os/workflow-definitions/drafts/:id/actions/activate`
      initially for procedure drafts, guarded by
      `company-os:workflow-definition:activate`, approved draft validation,
      stale-version rejection, previous-version deprecation, new active
      procedure version creation, procedure step copy/apply, audit/event
      evidence, MCP manifest supervision metadata, and denial coverage.
      `npm run build`, `npm test` against disposable PostgreSQL on
      `localhost:55434`, and `git diff --check` passed; the disposable
      container was removed.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-011 Process And Pipeline Workflow Versioning Migration
      Decision: added migration
      `202605143_workflow_root_version_uniqueness`, changed process/pipeline
      uniqueness to `workspaceId + name + version`, and extended workflow
      activation to process and pipeline drafts. Pipeline activation copies or
      applies stages; process activation creates a new active process version.
      Integration tests now cover process, pipeline, and procedure activation.
      `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`, `npm test` against disposable
      PostgreSQL on `localhost:55436`, and `git diff --check` passed; the
      disposable container was removed.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-012 Workflow Definition Draft Web Surface:
      added typed route-kit clients for workflow draft create, impact preview,
      and activation, then added a guarded `/react-company-os` panel for
      process, pipeline, and procedure roots. The panel creates a draft from an
      existing root, previews runtime impact, shows approval reasons, supports
      approval request, and gates activation on
      `company-os:workflow-definition:activate` plus approved approval ID when
      required. `npm run build` passed; real-backend Playwright proof on
      `http://127.0.0.1:3101/react-company-os` verified desktop render, create
      draft, impact preview, approval-required state, mobile DOM render, and
      zero relevant console issues.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-013 Workflow Draft History And Resume Decision:
      selected draft readback/resume before archive/rollback because web/API/MCP
      draft creation needs an owner-visible way to resume interrupted command
      flows after reload or agent handoff.
- [x] V2WEB-AGENT-014 Workflow Draft Readback And Resume Slice:
      added guarded workflow draft list/detail routes, route-kit loader, and a
      `/react-company-os` `Recent drafts` resume panel scoped to `status=draft`.
      API tests prove owner readback, cross-workspace isolation, read-only
      denial, and manifest exposure. `npm run build`, `npm test` against
      disposable PostgreSQL on `localhost:55438`, and Playwright resume proof
      against `http://127.0.0.1:3102/react-company-os` passed.
- [x] UXD-001 Company City UX Direction Decision:
      captured the user-approved cinematic-realistic Company City Map direction
      as canonical UX memory. Future dashboard and high-level map surfaces
      should treat the company as a strategic city/value ecosystem with
      `GENERAL` as the central intake district, 12 connected departments, a
      command brief, value journey, responsive web/mobile behavior, and light
      evidence-backed gamification.
- [x] UXD-002 Company City Dashboard V2 Target Spec:
      generated and saved the current Dashboard V2 visual target, then added
      `docs/ux/company-city-dashboard-v3-spec.md` with a zone table, operating
      district model, shared component inventory, responsive rules,
      interaction rules, visual rules, and known reference corrections so
      future UI work has a stable source of truth.
- [x] UXD-003 Company City Dashboard V3 Department Model:
      refined the Dashboard target around the user's canonical department list
      and saved `docs/ux/assets/company-city-dashboard-v3-target.png` plus the
      first drill-down target
      `docs/ux/assets/company-city-management-department-v1-target.png` for
      `12 Zarzadzanie`.
- [x] V1CLOSE-001 V1 Achievement And External Blocker Handoff:
      added `docs/operations/v1-achievement-and-blocker-handoff.md` and
      `docs/planning/v1-closure-task-contracts.md`, making the V1 achievement
      boundary and remaining external blockers recoverable from repository
      state.
- [x] V1EVID-001 Company OS Lifecycle Trace Smoke:
      added `scripts/company-os-lifecycle-trace-smoke.mjs` and
      `npm run company-os:trace-smoke`, then ran the local Docker command
      `docker compose exec -T backend sh -lc "npm run prisma:migrate:deploy &&
      npm run seed && npm run company-os:trace-smoke"`.
      Trace `v1evid-1778458446081` verified approval request/decision, stage
      start/validate/complete, automation dry-run/execute, `/v1/events`
      readback, `/v1/company-os/audit-logs/:id` readback, `eventCount=8`, and
      `auditLogCount=7`.
- [x] V1EVID-002 Operating Model Registry Lifecycle Smoke:
      added `scripts/operating-model-registry-lifecycle-smoke.mjs` and
      `npm run operating-model:registry-smoke`, then ran
      `docker compose exec -T backend sh -lc "npm run prisma:migrate:deploy &&
      npm run seed && npm run operating-model:registry-smoke"`.
      Trace `v1evid-om-1778459014284` verified folder, storage location,
      knowledge root, and automation definition create/read/update/delete,
      `/v1/operating-model` aggregate readback, deleted-resource `404`
      readback, and cross-workspace deny checks.
- [x] MCP-004 Dynamic MCP Profile UI Loading:
      owner console now loads backend canonical MCP key profiles from
      `/v1/api-keys/profiles`, keeps static presets only as fallback data, and
      creates unchanged profile keys with `profileId`.
- [x] MCP-005 MCP Bridge Runtime Smoke Harness:
      added `npm run mcp:smoke`, a repeatable stdio bridge smoke that verifies
      `initialize`, `tools/list`, and a safe `companycore_get_company_os`
      `tools/call`; integration tests run it with a real profile-created MCP
      key.
- [x] MCP-006 MCP Agent Runtime Setup Guide:
      added profile-to-runtime setup documentation for Codex, Paperclip-style,
      and generic MCP-compatible agents, including secret handling, smoke
      checks, prompt contract, and failure recovery.
- [x] MCP-003 MCP Agent Key Profiles:
      added canonical backend MCP key profiles, owner-only
      `/v1/api-keys/profiles`, `profileId` creation support, current MCP/Drive
      scopes in owner-console presets, and profile coverage in integration
      tests.
- [x] MCP-002 CompanyCore MCP Bridge Server:
      added the first thin stdio MCP bridge server. It reads
      `/v1/mcp/manifest`, exposes CompanyCore routes through `tools/list`, and
      calls the HTTP API through `tools/call` using a workspace-scoped service
      key.
- [x] MCP-001 MCP Bridge Manifest Foundation:
      expose a capability-scoped `/v1/mcp/manifest` tool catalog and include
      the same MCP-friendly manifest in `/v1/connection`, so agent runtimes can
      wrap CompanyCore routes as MCP tools without bypassing API policies,
      approvals, events, or audit logs.
- [x] CCOS-001 Company OS Stage 1 Data Foundation:
      audit current architecture/data/integration state, then add the
      workspace-scoped data foundation for processes, pipelines, enriched
      pipeline stages, procedures, procedure steps, company roles, resources,
      tool adapters, integration capabilities, standards, LuckySparrow seed
      data, targeted relation tests, and architecture/database docs.
- [x] CCOS-002 Company OS Stage 2 Runtime Evidence Foundation:
      add pipeline runs, stage runs, approvals, checklists, acceptance
      criteria, audit log, and event correlation using the CCOS-001 foundation.
- [x] CCOS-003 Company OS Stage 3 Governance Intelligence Foundation:
      add policy, metric/KPI, risk, control, knowledge item, decision log,
      automation rule, trigger, artifact, dependency, business function, and
      stakeholder foundations.
- [x] CCOS-004 Company OS Read API Surface:
      expose Stage 1-3 Company OS records through a scoped read-only API,
      add the `company-os:read` capability and connection-manifest routes,
      and cover owner/scoped-service access in integration tests.
- [x] CCOS-005 Company OS Dashboard Surface:
      added `/react-company-os` as the first React cockpit on
      `/v1/company-os`, with definition/runtime/governance metrics, attention
      queues, adapter health, and recent evidence.
- [x] CCOS-006 Company OS Collection Drill-Down:
      added read-only `/react-company-os` collection previews for pipelines,
      approvals, audit logs, risks, and tool adapters through
      `/v1/company-os/:collection`.
- [x] CCOS-007 Company OS Collection Detail Route:
      added selected-record inspection inside `/react-company-os`, backed by
      `/v1/company-os/:collection/:id`, with local idle/loading/error states,
      readable key fields, and capped raw API evidence while keeping lifecycle
      writes closed.
- [x] CCOS-008 Company OS Agent Context Panel:
      added a read-only MCP-oriented agent operating packet inside
      `/react-company-os`, loading `/v1/tasks` plus Company OS pipelines,
      procedures, tool adapters, policies, acceptance criteria, and approvals
      through existing API routes.
- [x] CCOS-009 Company OS Approval Lifecycle Design:
      documented command-shaped approval request and approval decision routes,
      fail-closed lifecycle rules, event/audit requirements, and future
      pipeline/stage action direction without exposing raw table mutations.
- [x] CCOS-010 Company OS Approval Lifecycle Backend:
      implemented `POST /v1/company-os/approvals/request` and
      `POST /v1/company-os/approvals/:id/decision` with capability gates,
      workspace checks, event/audit evidence, MCP manifest exposure, and
      integration tests.
- [x] CCOS-011 Company OS Approval UI Actions:
      added owner-facing request approval and approve/reject controls in
      `/react-company-os`, using the command-shaped backend routes with local
      action feedback and context refresh.
- [x] CCOS-012 Company OS Pipeline Stage Lifecycle Design:
      documented command-shaped start, block, validate, and complete stage
      routes with approval references, acceptance criteria gates, event names,
      audit actions, and invalid-transition failure rules.
- [x] CCOS-013 Company OS Stage Lifecycle Backend:
      implemented audited start-stage, block, validate, and complete stage
      lifecycle routes with capability gates, approval checks, acceptance
      criteria validation, event/audit evidence, and MCP manifest exposure.
- [x] CCOS-014 Company OS Stage Lifecycle UI Actions:
      added owner-facing start, block, validate, and complete controls to
      `/react-company-os` using shared React route-kit clients and the audited
      lifecycle command routes.
- [x] UXA-016 React Route Shell Extraction:
      extract shared React route helpers before adding a third workbench so
      `web/src/main.tsx` does not keep growing as a monolith.
      Added `web/src/react-route-kit.tsx` for shared route state hooks, API
      loaders, shell, notices, metrics, and table primitives while preserving
      existing React route behavior.
- [x] UXA-015 React Canonical Route Switch Readiness:
      after UXA-014, decide whether a React route can safely become canonical
      or whether remaining adapter/editor affordances need another slice.
      Decision: do not switch canonical routes yet; extract the shared React
      shell and primitives before the next workbench migration.
- [x] UXA-014 React Integration Map Workbench Route:
      migrate the integration map overview into a parallel React workbench
      route using live `/v1/connection` data, DaisyUI primitives, and clear
      provider/data-path states while preserving `/settings/integrations`.
      Added `/react-integrations`, provider/data-path cards, readiness
      guidance, metrics, filters, and a 12-area coverage table. Passed build,
      validate, Browser signed-out check, targeted signed-in desktop/mobile
      rendered checks, owner-console smoke, and container integration tests.
- [x] UXA-013 React Workbench Canonical Route Decision:
      decide whether the task workbench can replace the canonical
      `/tasks-adapter` route now or should remain a parallel React preview
      until one more workbench proves parity. Decision: keep `/react-tasks`
      parallel for now and migrate one more React workbench before considering
      a canonical route switch.
- [x] UXA-012 React Workbench Route Migration:
      migrate one high-value workbench route into React using the approved
      dashboard, table, and local-notification primitives while preserving
      vanilla fallback routes. Added `/react-tasks`, live `/v1/tasks`
      loading, task metrics, search/status/source/list filters, reusable table
      rendering, signed-out/loading/empty/error/success states, and links back
      to `/data/tasks` plus `/tasks-adapter`. Passed build, validate, Browser
      signed-out check, targeted signed-in desktop/mobile rendered checks,
      owner-console smoke, and container integration tests.
- [x] UXA-011 React Table And Notification Primitive Migration:
      create reusable React/DaisyUI table and local notification primitives for
      the next workbench migration while preserving existing vanilla routes.
      Added `LocalNotice`, generic `DataTable`, live operating-model preview
      rows, migration ledger reuse, React build-output cleanup, Docker build
      stage script copy, and passed build, validate, rendered React checks,
      owner-console smoke, and container integration tests.
- [x] UXA-010 React Dashboard Component Migration:
      migrate the dashboard command surface into reusable React components,
      starting with app-shell-safe primitives for command panel, attention rows,
      module launcher, notifications, and table foundation. Current stage:
      implementation on `/react-dashboard` with the existing vanilla
      `/dashboard` preserved. Added the `companycore` DaisyUI theme, live
      owner-session `/v1/connection` loading, dashboard primitives, explicit
      signed-out/loading/error/connected states, and passed build, validate,
      rendered React checks, owner-console smoke, and container integration
      tests.
- [x] UXA-009 React Tailwind DaisyUI Migration Foundation:
      introduce an explicit React + Vite + Tailwind + DaisyUI frontend
      foundation as a reversible architecture slice while preserving backend
      APIs, auth, deployment shape, and owner-console flows. Added `web/`,
      Vite/Tailwind/DaisyUI config, `/react-dashboard`, Docker build
      integration, ignored generated `public/react/`, and passed build,
      validate, rendered React checks, owner-console smoke, and container
      integration tests.
- [x] UXA-008 Dashboard Iconography And UX Governance:
      add local Phosphor icon assets, apply consistent dashboard operational
      iconography, and document canonical CompanyCore management-UI rules.
      Tailwind/DaisyUI are not currently installed, so any DaisyUI adoption is
      treated as a separate architecture/build-pipeline decision. Added
      vendored Phosphor bold assets, dashboard icons, management-first UX
      rules, and passed build, validate, targeted rendered checks,
      owner-console smoke, and container integration tests.
- [x] UXA-007 Mobile Private Header Compression:
      reduce authenticated mobile topbar height by keeping Menu, current route,
      and Sign out visible while moving module jumping to the existing drawer
      and preserving desktop/tablet topbar behavior. Mobile topbar now renders
      as one compact row, desktop module search remains visible, and isolated
      owner-console smoke passed at `http://localhost:3006`.
- [x] UXA-006 Local Action Feedback Placement:
      add local success/error/status placement for auth, provider setup, Drive
      import, typed editors, and API key lifecycle while preserving the global
      result panel for cross-route outcomes. Added local `aria-live` status
      slots for auth, ClickUp, and Google Drive actions, preserved typed editor
      and API key local feedback, and verified local feedback plus private-route
      smoke against isolated `http://localhost:3005`.
- [x] UXA-005 Workbench Visual Role Cleanup:
      reduce equal-weight panel fatigue across dense workbenches by clarifying
      command, filter, list, selected-detail, and feedback roles. Made filter
      surfaces quieter, repeated rows lighter, selected rows/details stronger,
      and verified private workbench screenshots at desktop/tablet/mobile.
- [x] UXA-004 Mobile Auth Action-First Layout:
      reorder mobile `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` so the form comes
      before onboarding context while desktop keeps the two-column layout.
      Verified mobile login/register form-first screenshots and desktop
      two-column auth preservation.
- [x] UXA-003 Dashboard First-Viewport Command Polish:
      tighten `/dashboard` so the first viewport has one dominant next action,
      visible blocker state, and quieter secondary module exploration. Moved
      readiness evidence into the cockpit, capped visible attention items,
      made modules secondary exploration, reduced the lower next-action panel
      to three links, and verified desktop/tablet/mobile screenshots.
- [x] UXA-002 Authenticated Private Route UX Evidence Harness:
      create or document an approved local authenticated screenshot path for
      the private owner-console routes, then capture desktop/tablet/mobile
      evidence without writing test data to production. Added
      `owner-console:ux-smoke`, captured all priority private routes at
      desktop/tablet/mobile, and recorded zero console issues in the local
      report.
- [x] UXA-001 CompanyCore V1 UX/UI Audit:
      audited the public/auth owner entry, local seeded runtime state, private
      route implementation patterns, and UX source-of-truth docs; published
      `docs/ux/companycore-v1-ux-ui-audit.md` and queued `UXA-002..UXA-006`.
- [x] CCV1-067 Tech Stack Runtime Status Refresh:
      update `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` so it reflects implemented auth,
      tests, migrations, owner console, ClickUp scheduler, and Google Drive v2
      foundation instead of older planned/foundation wording.
- [x] CCV1-066 Historical Guardrail Plan Classification:
      classify auth/workspace and regression-prevention planning docs as
      implemented historical guardrail plans, so they no longer read as active
      pre-v1-stability work.
- [x] CCV1-065 Front-Door Docs Scope Refresh:
      refresh `docs/README.md`, `docs/API.md`, and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` so
      they describe the current owner console and Google Drive v2 foundation
      instead of the earlier minimal-console/backend-only scope.
- [x] CCV1-064 Historical Checklist Closure:
      close stale unchecked AGCRUD planning criteria and the old blocked
      CCV1-009 contract using later accepted production and agent-runtime
      evidence.
- [x] CCV1-063 Historical Next Steps Refresh:
      replace stale `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` v1 foundation guidance with current
      post-release status, blocked work, and canonical queue pointers; update
      the planning catalog so historical plans are not mistaken for active v1
      work.
- [x] CCV1-062 V1 Operator Runtime Pointer Refresh:
      refresh operator handoff and rollback docs to reference the current
      public `/health` build/image `71f3eb3b063ea68226a1736c727c52882b33f27a`
      and record that VPS Docker inventory still needs an approved operator
      shell before rollback.
- [x] AGRUN-008 Route-Level Business Editing Surfaces:
      reconcile whether the typed Notes, Projects, Clients, Task Lists, and
      Tasks editor workbenches already close the route-level business editing
      gap; if not, select exactly one remaining implemented route slice.
- [x] CCV1-061 Agent State Source-Of-Truth Sync:
      replace placeholder `.agents/state/*` continuation files with current v1
      post-release focus, known blockers, health evidence, and the next
      executable queue item.

- [x] AGRUN-002 Service Key Scope Enforcement:
      enforce `api_keys.scopes` per route capability, keep owner bearer-token
      access intact, preserve existing production agent compatibility through
      an explicit broad-scope decision or migration, and test denied/allowed
      scoped-key behavior.
- [x] AGRUN-003 Machine-Readable Agent Contract:
      extend the `/v1/connection` agent contract with route payload/error
      metadata so agents can learn supported writes without guessing from prose
      docs.
- [x] AGRUN-004 Reusable Agent Training Smoke:
      add a secret-safe script and package command that proves connection,
      create/read/update/archive, agent-log write, and fail-closed behavior
      locally and in production.
- [x] AGCRUD-002 Business Read/Update API Completion:
      add missing single-record read and update routes for first-party
      business APIs, keep workspace guardrails, update the adapter manifest,
      and cover the behavior in integration tests.
- [x] AGCRUD-003 Business Archive/Delete Policy And Slice:
      document safe archive/delete semantics for business records, then
      implement one guarded deletion/archive slice.

## Historical Mixed Queue

- [x] CCOS-015 Company OS Automation Rule Execution Design:
      design how automation rules and triggers observe Company OS lifecycle
      events and request approved follow-up actions without bypassing policy,
      approval, event, or audit boundaries.
- [x] CCOS-016 Company OS Automation Rule Evaluator Backend:
      implement the first command-shaped automation evaluator route that
      evaluates an existing Company OS event against active triggers/rules,
      supports dry-run versus execute mode, and records fail-closed event/audit
      evidence without raw table mutation.
- [x] CCOS-017 Company OS Automation Evaluator UI Actions:
      expose owner-facing dry-run and execute controls for the audited
      automation evaluator inside `/react-company-os`, including local
      feedback and context refresh, without adding raw automation table
      mutation.
- [x] CCOS-018 Company OS Automation Lifecycle Helper Reuse Design:
      design how the automation evaluator should reuse stage lifecycle command
      logic for start, block, validate, and complete proposals without
      duplicating transition checks or bypassing approval/audit/event behavior.
- [x] CCOS-019 Company OS Stage Lifecycle Command Service Extraction:
      extract the existing stage lifecycle route logic into shared internal
      command functions while preserving current HTTP behavior, stable errors,
      events, audit logs, and tests.
- [x] CCOS-020 Company OS Automation Lifecycle Proposal Execution:
      enable automation evaluator lifecycle proposals to call the shared stage
      lifecycle command functions while preserving idempotency, approval
      checks, stable errors, events, audit logs, and fail-closed evidence.
- [x] UXA-017 React Workbench Third Route Candidate:
      migrate the next workbench only after UXA-016 reduces React route
      duplication and verifies existing routes still render.
- [x] UXA-018 React Canonical Route Switch Decision:
      decide whether `/react-areas`, `/react-tasks`, or `/react-integrations`
      can safely replace the matching canonical vanilla route, or whether
      another parity slice is required first.
- [x] UXA-019 React Areas Mapping Parity Slice:
      add relationship/provider scope signals and explicit current-action
      links to `/react-areas` so the React areas workbench moves closer to
      canonical `/areas` parity without replacing it yet.
- [x] UXA-020 React Areas Data Contract Gap Decision:
      decide whether React areas should gain a dedicated read API for provider
      mappings and Drive folder ownership before any canonical `/areas`
      replacement work.
- [x] UXA-021 React Areas Relationship Data Hook:
      reuse existing operating-model external mappings and Google Drive file
      endpoints in the React route kit, then enrich `/react-areas` with real
      mapping counts and review queues.
- [x] UXA-022 React Areas Canonical Switch Decision:
      decide whether `/react-areas` can replace canonical `/areas` after
      relationship data parity, or whether explicit React write controls are
      required first.
- [x] UXA-023 React Areas Scope Assignment Controls:
      add provider mapping and Drive item operating-area assignment controls to
      `/react-areas` using existing PATCH endpoints and local action feedback.
- [x] UXA-024 React Areas Canonical Switch Decision:
      decide whether `/react-areas` can now replace canonical `/areas` after
      read, review, and scope-assignment parity.
- [x] UXA-025 React Areas Area Lifecycle Controls:
      add user-created operating area create/delete controls to `/react-areas`
      using existing operating-model area endpoints before any canonical route
      switch.
- [x] UXA-026 React Areas Selected Context Parity Decision:
      decide the smallest safe selected-area context parity slice for
      `/react-areas`, including record previews and reassignment controls for
      already assigned provider/Drive items.
- [x] UXA-027 React Areas Selected Context Data Hook:
      load selected table record previews in the React route kit through
      existing `/v1/{apiSlug}` endpoints and render selected-area context in
      `/react-areas`.
- [x] UXA-028 React Areas Assigned Scope Reassignment Controls:
      add reassignment controls for already assigned provider mappings and
      Drive items in the `/react-areas` selected context.
- [x] UXA-029 React Areas Canonical Route Switch Decision:
      decide whether `/react-areas` can replace canonical `/areas` after
      read, lifecycle, selected context, and reassignment parity.
- [x] UXA-030 React Areas Canonical Route Switch:
      serve the validated React areas workbench at canonical `/areas` while
      preserving `/react-areas` as an alias.
- [x] UXA-031 V1 Architecture Completion Audit:
      audit the current V1 implementation against the approved Company OS
      architecture and identify whether architecture-derived local V1 blockers
      remain.
- [x] V1CTRL-001 Function Coverage Ledger:
      create a module-by-module confidence ledger for API, UI, MCP,
      integration, operations, and docs surfaces so future work is derived from
      verified gaps instead of ad hoc fixes.
- [x] V1CTRL-002 Canonical Queue Cleanup:
      reduce active queue noise and align `NOW`/`NEXT` with the function
      coverage ledger so old completed tasks, external blockers, and future V2
      ideas are not mistaken for active implementation work.
- [x] AGRUN-005 Scoped Agent Key Owner UI:
      expose scoped agent key creation, copy-once raw key display, rotation or
      deactivation, and capability presets in `/settings/api`.
- [x] AGRUN-006 Agent Event Ack Positive Smoke:
      create a controlled pending agent event, read it through a target service
      key, acknowledge it, verify it no longer appears as pending, and record
      production smoke evidence.
- [x] AGRUN-007 Google Drive Owner Consent And First Import:
      production evidence verified active OAuth, selected numbered-root import,
      748 Drive items, 171 folders, `unassignedCount=0`, and descendant scope
      `mismatches=[]`.
- [x] AGRUN-008 Route-Level Business Editing Surfaces:
      closed by evidence reconciliation; the typed editor workbenches for
      Notes, Projects, Clients, Task Lists, and Tasks are present locally and
      in production `app.js`.
- [x] AGRUN-009 Deploy Automation Reliability:
      audit whether current Coolify auto-deploy reliably updates production or
      document a one-command approved rollover path. First reconcile the
      current source-of-truth drift: this file contains a historical note about
      a successful auto-deploy, while operations docs still classify manual
      rollover as the approved path and auto-deploy tooling as unresolved.
- [x] AGCRUD-004 Registry Resource Lifecycle API:
      complete scoped lifecycle APIs for storage locations, knowledge roots,
      automation definitions, and operating folders.
- [x] AGCRUD-005 Provider/System Lifecycle Manifest:
      expose provider and system lifecycle actions to agents without raw
      system-table CRUD.
- [x] AGCRUD-006 Agent CompanyCore API Playbook:
      publish the agent read/write onboarding guide and smoke flow.
- [x] V2WEB-021 User-Created Area Deletion Guardrails:
      define system/user-created area metadata, protect `00. Glowny`, and only
      then expose safe delete controls for user-created areas.
- [ ] Continue v2 web console polish after main operating area foundation:
      deeper
      module editing surfaces should become route-level slices only when their
      data path is already implemented.
- [x] Source handoff package: document the OpenJarvis
      `5a426370` connector hygiene commit and the Paperclip `4cfa476f`
      adapter commit for managed upstream handoff.
- [ ] Blocked source merge execution: push or upstream the OpenJarvis
      CompanyCore connector hygiene change after write access or a fork/PR
      route is available.
- [ ] Blocked source merge execution: push or upstream the Paperclip
      `4cfa476f` adapter commit after write access or a fork/PR route is
      available.
- [x] Optional release automation evidence reconciliation: confirm whether the
      historical note about pushed commit `63348d6` supersedes the operations
      docs, or update the note so manual rollover remains the explicit approved
      path.

## Historical Group Queue

- [x] CCV1-A (docs and planning): CCV1-001, CCV1-002, CCV1-005
- [x] CCV1-B (workspace and auth): CCV1-011, CCV1-012, CCV1-013, CCV1-007
- [x] CCV1-C (regression prevention): CCV1-014, CCV1-015, CCV1-016, CCV1-017
- [x] CCV1-D (runtime foundation): CCV1-003, CCV1-004, CCV1-006, CCV1-010
- [x] CCV1-E (completion): CCV1-008, CCV1-009

The group queue is historical. Current active and blocked work is represented
in `NOW`, `NEXT`, `PIPELINE`, and `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`.

## Refill Rules

- Keep `NOW` small. Recommended maximum: 3 tasks.
- Move tasks from `NEXT` to `NOW` only when the current active slot is free.
- Use `PIPELINE` only when a larger execution wave needs continuity beyond
  `NEXT`.
- Use `GROUP QUEUE` when the project executes larger waves as grouped batches
  with explicit commit ranges.
- Keep this file synchronized with `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`.
- When publishing a new execution plan, activate the first executable tasks in
  `NOW` and `NEXT` in the same turn.
- Before reporting that no work is queued, verify both:
  - active canonical queue sections
  - background or historical unchecked checklists outside the canonical queue,
    clearly labeled as non-active if found.
