# MVP Next Commits

Keep this file short and execution-focused. The active queue must stay
synchronized with `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`.

## NOW

- [x] AGRUN-002 Service Key Scope Enforcement:
      enforce `api_keys.scopes` per route capability, keep owner bearer-token
      access intact, preserve existing production agent compatibility through
      an explicit broad-scope decision or migration, and test denied/allowed
      scoped-key behavior.
- [x] AGRUN-003 Machine-Readable Agent Contract:
      extend the `/v1/connection` agent contract with route payload/error
      metadata so agents can learn supported writes without guessing from prose
      docs.
- [x] AGRUN-004 Reusable Agent Training Smoke:
      add a secret-safe script and package command that proves connection,
      create/read/update/archive, agent-log write, and fail-closed behavior
      locally and in production.
- [x] AGCRUD-002 Business Read/Update API Completion:
      add missing single-record read and update routes for first-party
      business APIs, keep workspace guardrails, update the adapter manifest,
      and cover the behavior in integration tests.
- [x] AGCRUD-003 Business Archive/Delete Policy And Slice:
      document safe archive/delete semantics for business records, then
      implement one guarded deletion/archive slice.

## NEXT

- [x] AGRUN-005 Scoped Agent Key Owner UI:
      expose scoped agent key creation, copy-once raw key display, rotation or
      deactivation, and capability presets in `/settings/api`.
- [x] AGRUN-006 Agent Event Ack Positive Smoke:
      create a controlled pending agent event, read it through a target service
      key, acknowledge it, verify it no longer appears as pending, and record
      production smoke evidence.
- [ ] AGRUN-007 Google Drive Owner Consent And First Import:
      blocked until real OAuth credentials and owner consent are available;
      then connect Drive, import a selected folder, and prove agent file
      readback through CompanyCore.
- [ ] AGRUN-008 Route-Level Business Editing Surfaces:
      continue web-console editing one implemented route at a time after the
      P0/P1 agent safety tasks are done.
- [ ] AGRUN-009 Deploy Automation Reliability:
      audit whether current Coolify auto-deploy reliably updates production or
      document a one-command approved rollover path.
- [x] AGCRUD-004 Registry Resource Lifecycle API:
      complete scoped lifecycle APIs for storage locations, knowledge roots,
      automation definitions, and operating folders.
- [x] AGCRUD-005 Provider/System Lifecycle Manifest:
      expose provider and system lifecycle actions to agents without raw
      system-table CRUD.
- [x] AGCRUD-006 Agent CompanyCore API Playbook:
      publish the agent read/write onboarding guide and smoke flow.
- [x] V2WEB-021 User-Created Area Deletion Guardrails:
      define system/user-created area metadata, protect `00. Glowny`, and only
      then expose safe delete controls for user-created areas.
- [ ] Continue v2 web console polish after main operating area foundation:
      deeper
      module editing surfaces should become route-level slices only when their
      data path is already implemented.
- [x] Source handoff package: document the OpenJarvis
      `5a426370` connector hygiene commit and the Paperclip `4cfa476f`
      adapter commit for managed upstream handoff.
- [ ] Blocked source merge execution: push or upstream the OpenJarvis
      CompanyCore connector hygiene change after write access or a fork/PR
      route is available.
- [ ] Blocked source merge execution: push or upstream the Paperclip
      `4cfa476f` adapter commit after write access or a fork/PR route is
      available.
- [x] Optional release automation: confirm GitHub-to-Coolify auto-deploy path
      without GitHub Actions; Coolify auto deploy was enabled, received the
      pushed `63348d6` commit, and succeeded after reloading the compose file.

## Refill Rules

- Keep `NOW` small. Recommended maximum: 3 tasks.
- Move tasks from `NEXT` to `NOW` only when the current active slot is free.
- Use `PIPELINE` only when a larger execution wave needs continuity beyond
  `NEXT`.
- Use `GROUP QUEUE` when the project executes larger waves as grouped batches
  with explicit commit ranges.
- Keep this file synchronized with `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`.
- When publishing a new execution plan, activate the first executable tasks in
  `NOW` and `NEXT` in the same turn.
- Before reporting that no work is queued, verify both:
  - active canonical queue sections
  - background or historical unchecked checklists outside the canonical queue,
    clearly labeled as non-active if found.
