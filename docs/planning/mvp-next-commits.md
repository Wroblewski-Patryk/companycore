## NOW

- [ ] UXA-012 React Workbench Route Migration:
      migrate one high-value workbench route into React using the approved
      dashboard, table, and local-notification primitives while preserving
      vanilla fallback routes.
- [x] UXA-011 React Table And Notification Primitive Migration:
      create reusable React/DaisyUI table and local notification primitives for
      the next workbench migration while preserving existing vanilla routes.
      Added `LocalNotice`, generic `DataTable`, live operating-model preview
      rows, migration ledger reuse, React build-output cleanup, Docker build
      stage script copy, and passed build, validate, rendered React checks,
      owner-console smoke, and container integration tests.
- [x] UXA-010 React Dashboard Component Migration:
      migrate the dashboard command surface into reusable React components,
      starting with app-shell-safe primitives for command panel, attention rows,
      module launcher, notifications, and table foundation. Current stage:
      implementation on `/react-dashboard` with the existing vanilla
      `/dashboard` preserved. Added the `companycore` DaisyUI theme, live
      owner-session `/v1/connection` loading, dashboard primitives, explicit
      signed-out/loading/error/connected states, and passed build, validate,
      rendered React checks, owner-console smoke, and container integration
      tests.
- [x] UXA-009 React Tailwind DaisyUI Migration Foundation:
      introduce an explicit React + Vite + Tailwind + DaisyUI frontend
      foundation as a reversible architecture slice while preserving backend
      APIs, auth, deployment shape, and owner-console flows. Added `web/`,
      Vite/Tailwind/DaisyUI config, `/react-dashboard`, Docker build
      integration, ignored generated `public/react/`, and passed build,
      validate, rendered React checks, owner-console smoke, and container
      integration tests.
- [x] UXA-008 Dashboard Iconography And UX Governance:
      add local Phosphor icon assets, apply consistent dashboard operational
      iconography, and document canonical CompanyCore management-UI rules.
      Tailwind/DaisyUI are not currently installed, so any DaisyUI adoption is
      treated as a separate architecture/build-pipeline decision. Added
      vendored Phosphor bold assets, dashboard icons, management-first UX
      rules, and passed build, validate, targeted rendered checks,
      owner-console smoke, and container integration tests.
- [x] UXA-007 Mobile Private Header Compression:
      reduce authenticated mobile topbar height by keeping Menu, current route,
      and Sign out visible while moving module jumping to the existing drawer
      and preserving desktop/tablet topbar behavior. Mobile topbar now renders
      as one compact row, desktop module search remains visible, and isolated
      owner-console smoke passed at `http://localhost:3006`.
- [x] UXA-006 Local Action Feedback Placement:
      add local success/error/status placement for auth, provider setup, Drive
      import, typed editors, and API key lifecycle while preserving the global
      result panel for cross-route outcomes. Added local `aria-live` status
      slots for auth, ClickUp, and Google Drive actions, preserved typed editor
      and API key local feedback, and verified local feedback plus private-route
      smoke against isolated `http://localhost:3005`.
- [x] UXA-005 Workbench Visual Role Cleanup:
      reduce equal-weight panel fatigue across dense workbenches by clarifying
      command, filter, list, selected-detail, and feedback roles. Made filter
      surfaces quieter, repeated rows lighter, selected rows/details stronger,
      and verified private workbench screenshots at desktop/tablet/mobile.
- [x] UXA-004 Mobile Auth Action-First Layout:
      reorder mobile `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` so the form comes
      before onboarding context while desktop keeps the two-column layout.
      Verified mobile login/register form-first screenshots and desktop
      two-column auth preservation.
- [x] UXA-003 Dashboard First-Viewport Command Polish:
      tighten `/dashboard` so the first viewport has one dominant next action,
      visible blocker state, and quieter secondary module exploration. Moved
      readiness evidence into the cockpit, capped visible attention items,
      made modules secondary exploration, reduced the lower next-action panel
      to three links, and verified desktop/tablet/mobile screenshots.
- [x] UXA-002 Authenticated Private Route UX Evidence Harness:
      create or document an approved local authenticated screenshot path for
      the private owner-console routes, then capture desktop/tablet/mobile
      evidence without writing test data to production. Added
      `owner-console:ux-smoke`, captured all priority private routes at
      desktop/tablet/mobile, and recorded zero console issues in the local
      report.
- [x] UXA-001 CompanyCore V1 UX/UI Audit:
      audited the public/auth owner entry, local seeded runtime state, private
      route implementation patterns, and UX source-of-truth docs; published
      `docs/ux/companycore-v1-ux-ui-audit.md` and queued `UXA-002..UXA-006`.
- [x] CCV1-067 Tech Stack Runtime Status Refresh:
      update `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` so it reflects implemented auth,
      tests, migrations, owner console, ClickUp scheduler, and Google Drive v2
      foundation instead of older planned/foundation wording.
- [x] CCV1-066 Historical Guardrail Plan Classification:
      classify auth/workspace and regression-prevention planning docs as
      implemented historical guardrail plans, so they no longer read as active
      pre-v1-stability work.
- [x] CCV1-065 Front-Door Docs Scope Refresh:
      refresh `docs/README.md`, `docs/API.md`, and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` so
      they describe the current owner console and Google Drive v2 foundation
      instead of the earlier minimal-console/backend-only scope.
- [x] CCV1-064 Historical Checklist Closure:
      close stale unchecked AGCRUD planning criteria and the old blocked
      CCV1-009 contract using later accepted production and agent-runtime
      evidence.
- [x] CCV1-063 Historical Next Steps Refresh:
      replace stale `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` v1 foundation guidance with current
      post-release status, blocked work, and canonical queue pointers; update
      the planning catalog so historical plans are not mistaken for active v1
      work.
- [x] CCV1-062 V1 Operator Runtime Pointer Refresh:
      refresh operator handoff and rollback docs to reference the current
      public `/health` build/image `71f3eb3b063ea68226a1736c727c52882b33f27a`
      and record that VPS Docker inventory still needs an approved operator
      shell before rollback.
- [x] AGRUN-008 Route-Level Business Editing Surfaces:
      reconcile whether the typed Notes, Projects, Clients, Task Lists, and
      Tasks editor workbenches already close the route-level business editing
      gap; if not, select exactly one remaining implemented route slice.
- [x] CCV1-061 Agent State Source-Of-Truth Sync:
      replace placeholder `.agents/state/*` continuation files with current v1
      post-release focus, known blockers, health evidence, and the next
      executable queue item.

- [x] AGRUN-002 Service Key Scope Enforcement:
      enforce `api_keys.scopes` per route capability, keep owner bearer-token
      access intact, preserve existing production agent compatibility through
      an explicit broad-scope decision or migration, and test denied/allowed
      scoped-key behavior.
- [x] AGRUN-003 Machine-Readable Agent Contract:
      extend the `/v1/connection` agent contract with route payload/error
      metadata so agents can learn supported writes without guessing from prose
      docs.
- [x] AGRUN-004 Reusable Agent Training Smoke:
      add a secret-safe script and package command that proves connection,
      create/read/update/archive, agent-log write, and fail-closed behavior
      locally and in production.
- [x] AGCRUD-002 Business Read/Update API Completion:
      add missing single-record read and update routes for first-party
      business APIs, keep workspace guardrails, update the adapter manifest,
      and cover the behavior in integration tests.
- [x] AGCRUD-003 Business Archive/Delete Policy And Slice:
      document safe archive/delete semantics for business records, then
      implement one guarded deletion/archive slice.

## NEXT

- [x] AGRUN-005 Scoped Agent Key Owner UI:
      expose scoped agent key creation, copy-once raw key display, rotation or
      deactivation, and capability presets in `/settings/api`.
- [x] AGRUN-006 Agent Event Ack Positive Smoke:
      create a controlled pending agent event, read it through a target service
      key, acknowledge it, verify it no longer appears as pending, and record
      production smoke evidence.
- [ ] AGRUN-007 Google Drive Owner Consent And First Import:
      blocked until real OAuth credentials and owner consent are available;
      then connect Drive, import a selected folder, and prove agent file
      readback through CompanyCore.
- [x] AGRUN-008 Route-Level Business Editing Surfaces:
      closed by evidence reconciliation; the typed editor workbenches for
      Notes, Projects, Clients, Task Lists, and Tasks are present locally and
      in production `app.js`.
- [x] AGRUN-009 Deploy Automation Reliability:
      audit whether current Coolify auto-deploy reliably updates production or
      document a one-command approved rollover path. First reconcile the
      current source-of-truth drift: this file contains a historical note about
      a successful auto-deploy, while operations docs still classify manual
      rollover as the approved path and auto-deploy tooling as unresolved.
- [x] AGCRUD-004 Registry Resource Lifecycle API:
      complete scoped lifecycle APIs for storage locations, knowledge roots,
      automation definitions, and operating folders.
- [x] AGCRUD-005 Provider/System Lifecycle Manifest:
      expose provider and system lifecycle actions to agents without raw
      system-table CRUD.
- [x] AGCRUD-006 Agent CompanyCore API Playbook:
      publish the agent read/write onboarding guide and smoke flow.
- [x] V2WEB-021 User-Created Area Deletion Guardrails:
      define system/user-created area metadata, protect `00. Glowny`, and only
      then expose safe delete controls for user-created areas.
- [ ] Continue v2 web console polish after main operating area foundation:
      deeper
      module editing surfaces should become route-level slices only when their
      data path is already implemented.
- [x] Source handoff package: document the OpenJarvis
      `5a426370` connector hygiene commit and the Paperclip `4cfa476f`
      adapter commit for managed upstream handoff.
- [ ] Blocked source merge execution: push or upstream the OpenJarvis
      CompanyCore connector hygiene change after write access or a fork/PR
      route is available.
- [ ] Blocked source merge execution: push or upstream the Paperclip
      `4cfa476f` adapter commit after write access or a fork/PR route is
      available.
- [x] Optional release automation evidence reconciliation: confirm whether the
      historical note about pushed commit `63348d6` supersedes the operations
      docs, or update the note so manual rollover remains the explicit approved
      path.

## GROUP QUEUE

- [x] CCV1-A (docs and planning): CCV1-001, CCV1-002, CCV1-005
- [x] CCV1-B (workspace and auth): CCV1-011, CCV1-012, CCV1-013, CCV1-007
- [x] CCV1-C (regression prevention): CCV1-014, CCV1-015, CCV1-016, CCV1-017
- [x] CCV1-D (runtime foundation): CCV1-003, CCV1-004, CCV1-006, CCV1-010
- [x] CCV1-E (completion): CCV1-008, CCV1-009

The group queue is historical. Current active and blocked work is represented
in `NOW`, `NEXT`, `PIPELINE`, and `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`.

## Refill Rules

- Keep `NOW` small. Recommended maximum: 3 tasks.
- Move tasks from `NEXT` to `NOW` only when the current active slot is free.
- Use `PIPELINE` only when a larger execution wave needs continuity beyond
  `NEXT`.
- Use `GROUP QUEUE` when the project executes larger waves as grouped batches
  with explicit commit ranges.
- Keep this file synchronized with `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`.
- When publishing a new execution plan, activate the first executable tasks in
  `NOW` and `NEXT` in the same turn.
- Before reporting that no work is queued, verify both:
  - active canonical queue sections
  - background or historical unchecked checklists outside the canonical queue,
    clearly labeled as non-active if found.
