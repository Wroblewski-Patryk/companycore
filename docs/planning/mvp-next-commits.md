## Refill Rules

- Keep `NOW` small. Recommended maximum: 3 tasks.
- Move tasks from `NEXT` to `NOW` only when the current active slot is free.
- Use `PIPELINE` only when a larger execution wave needs continuity beyond
  `NEXT`.
- Use `GROUP QUEUE` when the project executes larger waves as grouped batches
  with explicit commit ranges.
- Keep this file synchronized with `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`.
- When publishing a new execution plan, activate the first executable tasks in
  `NOW` and `NEXT` in the same turn.
- Before reporting that no work is queued, verify both:
  - active canonical queue sections
  - background or historical unchecked checklists outside the canonical queue,
    clearly labeled as non-active if found.
