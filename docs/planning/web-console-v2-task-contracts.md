# Web Console V2 Task Contracts

## UXA-001 CompanyCore V1 UX/UI Audit

- Task Type: design/research
- Current Stage: verification
- Deliverable For This Stage: evidence-driven UX/UI audit and implementation
  plan for owner-console polish.
- Goal: Evaluate CompanyCore v1 from the owner's point of view and translate
  the findings into a small implementation queue.
- Scope:
  - `docs/ux/companycore-v1-ux-ui-audit.md`
  - `docs/planning/web-console-v2-task-contracts.md`
  - `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `.agents/state/current-focus.md`
  - `.agents/state/next-steps.md`
- Implementation Plan:
  - Review project UX contracts, design memory, scorecard, screen checklist,
    and anti-patterns.
  - Inspect public/auth routes in the Browser plugin on production.
  - Start a local Docker runtime on a non-production port and inspect seeded
    authenticated API state.
  - Audit private screens from source, local API state, and existing UX
    patterns when authenticated Browser entry is blocked.
  - Publish a prioritized UX implementation queue.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Audit identifies current strengths, user-facing problems, severity, and
    implementation slices.
  - Audit includes production/browser evidence and local runtime evidence.
  - Authenticated screenshot limitation is recorded honestly instead of hidden.
  - Canonical queue files point at the first executable UX slice.
- Definition of Done:
  - `git diff --check` passes.
  - Browser evidence covers public entry, login, register, and mobile auth.
  - Local runtime health and seeded authenticated API state are recorded.
  - Project state, task board, next-commits, and agent state are updated.
- Result Report:
  - Added `docs/ux/companycore-v1-ux-ui-audit.md`.
  - Scored the current owner console average at `3.42/5`.
  - Identified P0 issues in dashboard command focus and mobile auth action
    order.
  - Queued the next implementation wave as `UXA-002..UXA-006`.
  - Browser could not complete authenticated private-route clickthrough because
    this Browser runtime failed typing into `input[type=email]` and blocked
    `javascript:` session injection; the next task explicitly creates an
    approved authenticated evidence path.

## UXA-002 Authenticated Private Route UX Evidence Harness

- Task Type: qa/design-tooling
- Current Stage: done
- Deliverable For This Stage: approved local authenticated screenshot and
  interaction smoke for private owner-console UX review.
- Goal: Unblock evidence-driven private-route polish without production writes
  or Browser security-policy bypasses.
- Scope:
  - `scripts/owner-console-ux-smoke.mjs`
  - `package.json`
  - `package-lock.json`
  - `docs/ux/companycore-v1-ux-ui-audit.md`
  - `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `.agents/state/current-focus.md`
  - `.agents/state/next-steps.md`
  - `.agents/state/system-health.md`
  - `.agents/state/known-issues.md`
- Implementation Plan:
  - Add a local Playwright smoke script that authenticates through
    `/auth/login`, seeds the owner token into session storage before page load,
    and captures private routes without submitting write actions.
  - Cover `/dashboard`, `/data`, `/data/tasks`, `/areas`, `/relationships`,
    `/settings/drive`, and `/settings/api` at desktop, tablet, and mobile
    viewports.
  - Add desktop interaction proof for the module switcher, data filter, typed
    tasks editor draft state, and disabled Drive import setup control.
  - Save screenshots and a JSON report outside the repository by default.
  - Update planning and state files so UXA-003 can start from real private-route
    evidence.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Private-route screenshots exist for all priority routes at desktop, tablet,
    and mobile.
  - Smoke proves signed-in hydration and fails on page errors, console
    warnings/errors, missing signed-in state, or enabled Drive import without
    setup.
  - Interaction proof covers navigation/module switcher, one filter, one
    editor draft state, and one disabled setup form state.
  - The workflow does not create production users, write production data, or
    rely on `javascript:` URL injection.
- Definition of Done:
  - `node --check scripts/owner-console-ux-smoke.mjs` passes.
  - `npm run owner-console:ux-smoke` passes against local Docker runtime on
    `http://localhost:3000`.
  - `git diff --check` passes.
  - Task board, next steps, project state, system health, and UX audit evidence
    are updated.
- Result Report:
  - Added `scripts/owner-console-ux-smoke.mjs` and the
    `owner-console:ux-smoke` package command.
  - Added Playwright as a dev dependency in package metadata for the local UX
    evidence workflow.
  - Local run passed against `http://localhost:3000`.
  - Artifacts were written to
    `C:\Users\wrobl\AppData\Local\Temp\companycore-ux-smoke\2026-05-08T19-47-08-826Z`.
  - Captured all seven private routes at `1440x960`, `834x1112`, and `390x844`,
    plus desktop interaction screenshots for module search, data filtering,
    tasks editor draft state, and disabled Drive import.
  - Console issues were empty, and all signed-in/private-route assertions
    passed.
  - Screenshot observations confirm UXA-003: the dashboard first viewport is
    still too panel-heavy and mobile dashboard pushes the primary action below
    the fold.

## UXA-003 Dashboard First-Viewport Command Polish

- Task Type: design/frontend
- Current Stage: done
- Operation Mode: BUILDER
- Deliverable For This Stage: a tighter `/dashboard` first viewport that makes
  the current priority, blockers, and next action dominant before secondary
  module exploration.
- Process Self-Audit:
  - Analyze current state: UXA-002 screenshots and v1 UX audit reviewed.
  - Select exactly one priority task: UXA-003 only.
  - Plan implementation: reuse the existing command center, attention queue,
    readiness lanes, summary cards, and module launch patterns.
  - Execute implementation: scoped to dashboard markup, dashboard render logic,
    shared CSS, and source-of-truth docs.
  - Verify and test: build, syntax check, integration test, and authenticated UX
    smoke with desktop/tablet/mobile screenshots.
  - Self-review: confirm no architecture/API/backend behavior changed and no
    duplicate dashboard mechanism was introduced.
  - Update documentation and knowledge: task board, project state, next steps,
    and UX memory if the refined pattern should be reused.
- Goal: Make the owner dashboard answer "what matters now, what is blocked, and
  what should I click next" within the first viewport.
- Scope:
  - `public/index.html`
  - `public/app.js`
  - `public/styles.css`
  - `docs/ux/design-memory.md`
  - `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `.agents/state/current-focus.md`
  - `.agents/state/next-steps.md`
  - `.agents/state/system-health.md`
- Implementation Plan:
  - Move workspace, ClickUp, Drive, and data readiness evidence into a compact
    strip inside the existing cockpit instead of presenting separate competing
    health cards immediately below it.
  - Keep the attention queue beside the cockpit on desktop and stacked below it
    on mobile, but cap visible attention items so the first screen remains
    decisive.
  - Turn the large module launcher into a secondary exploration section below
    the command decision area.
  - Reduce the lower next-action panel to a short continuation path instead of
    a directory of equal-weight buttons.
  - Tighten dashboard mobile spacing so the dominant action appears earlier
    without hiding context.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - First viewport shows one dominant current-priority action and one secondary
    action.
  - Blocker count and reason are visible without scrolling on desktop and near
    the top on mobile.
  - Module launch grid reads as secondary exploration, not a competing command
    center.
  - Lower next-action panel has no more than three action links.
  - Desktop, tablet, and mobile screenshots show no overlap, horizontal
    overflow, or developer-looking diagnostic text.
- Definition of Done:
  - `node --check public/app.js` passes.
  - `npm run build` and `npm run validate` pass.
  - Integration test command passes against the local Docker backend service.
  - `npm run owner-console:ux-smoke` passes and records desktop/tablet/mobile
    screenshots for `/dashboard`.
  - `git diff --check` passes.
- Validation Evidence:
  - `node --check public/app.js` passed.
  - `npm run build` passed.
  - `npm run validate` passed.
  - Container-scoped Prisma migration plus Node integration test passed inside
    the backend service.
  - `npm run owner-console:ux-smoke` passed against isolated local compose
    project `companycore_uxa003` at `http://localhost:3002`.
  - Screenshot artifacts:
    `C:\Users\wrobl\AppData\Local\Temp\companycore-ux-smoke\2026-05-08T20-00-12-315Z`.
- Result Report:
  - Moved workspace, ClickUp, Google Drive, and data readiness evidence into a
    compact cockpit strip.
  - Removed the competing first-viewport health-card row.
  - Limited visible attention rows to the top three signals with a concise
    overflow note when more signals exist.
  - Renamed the module launcher to secondary `Explore modules` context and
    moved it below the command decision area.
  - Reduced the lower next-action panel from ten links to three continuation
    links.
  - Removed secondary header shortcuts that appeared above the primary action
    on mobile.
  - Updated design memory with the refined command-center pattern and captured
    a local smoke isolation guardrail in the learning journal.

## UXA-004 Mobile Auth Action-First Layout

- Task Type: design/frontend
- Current Stage: done
- Operation Mode: BUILDER
- Deliverable For This Stage: mobile `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` show
  the form before onboarding context while preserving desktop two-column auth.
- Process Self-Audit:
  - Analyze current state: UX audit P0 mobile auth finding and existing auth
    context pattern reviewed.
  - Select exactly one priority task: UXA-004 only.
  - Plan implementation: keep existing auth markup and desktop pattern; use
    responsive ordering and spacing only.
  - Execute implementation: scoped to auth CSS plus source-of-truth docs.
  - Verify and test: syntax/build, rendered public auth screenshots, and
    regression checks.
  - Self-review: confirm auth logic, routes, validation, and copy remain stable.
  - Update documentation and knowledge: task board, project state, next steps,
    and design memory when the responsive pattern should guide future auth work.
- Goal: Let returning owners reach sign-in and account creation fields before
  static onboarding context on phone-sized screens.
- Scope:
  - `public/styles.css`
  - `docs/ux/design-memory.md`
  - `docs/ux/companycore-v1-ux-ui-audit.md`
  - `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `.agents/state/current-focus.md`
  - `.agents/state/next-steps.md`
  - `.agents/state/system-health.md`
- Implementation Plan:
  - Keep desktop auth as context panel plus form in the current two-column
    layout.
  - On responsive stacked layouts, order `.auth-card` before
    `.auth-context-card`.
  - Tighten mobile auth spacing enough that the primary form and submit action
    appear early without hiding context below.
  - Verify login and register at mobile and desktop widths.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Mobile login shows the sign-in form before onboarding context.
  - Mobile register shows account creation fields before onboarding context.
  - Desktop login/register preserve the existing two-column layout.
  - Required fields, submit buttons, links, focus styling, and auth route
    redirects remain intact.
- Definition of Done:
  - `node --check public/app.js` passes.
  - `npm run build` and `npm run validate` pass.
  - Rendered screenshots verify mobile login/register and desktop auth.
  - `git diff --check` passes.
- Validation Evidence:
  - Browser plugin page identity and DOM check passed for
    `http://localhost:3003/auth/login`; console warnings/errors were empty.
  - Browser screenshot capture timed out, so rendered viewport evidence fell
    back to local Playwright screenshots.
  - `node --check public/app.js` passed.
  - `npm run build` passed.
  - Local Playwright auth smoke passed for desktop `1440x960` and mobile
    `390x844`.
  - Screenshot artifacts:
    `C:\Users\wrobl\AppData\Local\Temp\companycore-auth-ux-smoke\2026-05-08T20-08-09-640Z`.
- Result Report:
  - Added responsive ordering so `.auth-card` appears before
    `.auth-context-card` when the auth grid stacks.
  - Preserved desktop login/register as two-column context plus form layouts.
  - Tightened mobile auth spacing and context-card padding.
  - Verified mobile login and register show their forms before context and keep
    submit buttons visible inside the first viewport.

## V2WEB-049 Table Workbench Empty State Polish

- Task Type: design/frontend
- Current Stage: done
- Deliverable For This Stage: the table workbench shows actionable empty states
  for unsupported tables, signed-out access, empty record lists, filtered-out
  lists, and inspector selection.
- Goal: Make route-level business editing surfaces feel intentional even when
  no records are loaded yet, so operators know the next action without reading
  raw table context.
- Scope:
  - `public/app.js`
  - `public/styles.css`
  - `docs/ux/design-memory.md`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`

    optional local action.
  - Replace generic table record and inspector empty notes with actionable
    states for unsupported, signed-out, no-records, filtered, and select-record
    conditions.
  - Add a clear-filters action and a new-draft action through existing table
    workbench state.
  - Style the empty state as a compact reusable panel that works inside lists
    and inspector surfaces.
  - Validate syntax/build, tests, and desktop/mobile table workbench rendering.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Empty record lists explain whether the table has no records or filters are
    hiding matches.
  - Typed editable tables offer `New draft` from the empty record-list state.
  - Filtered-out lists offer `Clear filters` and update the table view.
  - Inspector empty state explains selection or creation without raw backend
    language.

    responsive layout, and no console errors.
- Result Report:
  - Added a reusable table-workbench empty state helper with title, message,
    and optional local action.
  - Replaced generic `/data-table` record-list and inspector notes with
    actionable states for unsupported table routes, protected signed-out
    routing, empty record lists, filtered-out lists, and selection/creation
    context.
  - Added local `New draft` and `Clear filters` actions through existing table
    workbench state; no backend behavior, API routes, or CRUD semantics were
    changed.
  - Added compact empty-state styling that works inside record lists and
    inspector panels on desktop and mobile.
  - Passed `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`,
    and `npm test` against disposable Postgres on port `55505`.
  - Passed local Playwright smoke against disposable Postgres on port `55504`;
    smoke verified protected `/data/notes` sign-in feedback, new-workspace
    empty Notes state, `New draft`, note creation, filtered-out record-list and
    inspector states, `Clear filters`, mobile layout, and no console/page
    errors or horizontal overflow.
  - Browser plugin fallback was required because the Browser tool was not
    exposed in this session.

## V2WEB-048 Global Feedback Panel Polish

- Task Type: design/frontend
- Current Stage: done
- Deliverable For This Stage: the shared `#resultPanel` shows clearer action
  feedback for success and error states.

    language.
  - Passed `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`,
    and `npm test` against disposable Postgres on port `55503`.
  - Passed local Playwright desktop/mobile smoke for wrong-login error feedback
    and successful workspace creation feedback; smoke verified tone labels,
    message boxes, no horizontal overflow, and no unexpected console/page
    errors. The expected `401 Unauthorized` response from the wrong-login
    action was filtered as the tested failure path.
  - Browser plugin fallback was required because node_repl resolved Node
    `22.13.0` while the plugin requires `>=22.22.0`.

## V2WEB-033 App Shell Navigation Polish

- Task Type: design/frontend
- Current Stage: done
- Deliverable For This Stage: owner console navigation is grouped into
  command, operate, integration, and workspace lanes without changing route
  behavior.
- Goal: Make the application shell feel like a usable operating center across
  all screens by reducing sidebar scanning cost and making active navigation
  state clearer.
- Scope:
  - `public/index.html`
  - `public/styles.css`
  - `docs/ux/design-memory.md`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`

    mobile with no console errors or horizontal overflow.
- Result Report:
  - Grouped sidebar navigation into Command, Operate, Integrations, and
    Workspace sections.
  - Added reusable sidebar-section styling, clearer active route affordance,
    hover border, and independent sidebar scrolling.
  - Preserved all route URLs, `data-link`, and `data-nav` attributes.
  - Validation passed: `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`,
    `git diff --check`, and `npm test` against disposable Postgres database
    `companycore_test` on port `55471`.
  - Local `/dashboard` Playwright shell smoke passed on desktop `1440x960` and
    mobile `390x844`: four sidebar groups rendered, active dashboard route was
    preserved, there were no console errors, and no horizontal overflow.
    Browser plugin validation was attempted first but remained blocked because
    its Node REPL requires Node `>=22.22.0` while this workstation exposes Node
    `22.13.0`.

## V2WEB-032 Dashboard Command Layout Polish

- Task Type: design/frontend
- Current Stage: done
- Deliverable For This Stage: dashboard first viewport behaves more like an
  operational command center by pairing priority, readiness lanes, and the
  attention queue in one scan path.
- Goal: Make the owner console dashboard answer "what matters now, what is
  blocked, and where do I click next" faster without adding new backend
  behavior.
- Scope:
  - `public/index.html`
  - `public/styles.css`
  - `docs/ux/design-memory.md`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
  - `docs/planning/web-console-v2-task-contracts.md`
- Implementation Plan:
  - Place the operational cockpit and attention queue in a shared responsive
    dashboard command layout.
  - Keep readiness lanes inside the cockpit and move workspace/provider status
    cards into a tighter health strip.
  - Preserve existing IDs and JavaScript data wiring so dashboard behavior,
    links, and attention ranking remain unchanged.
  - Validate syntax, build, tests, and desktop/mobile dashboard render.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Desktop dashboard first viewport shows current priority, readiness lanes,
    and attention items side by side without layout overflow.
  - Mobile stacks the same cockpit, attention queue, and health strip in a
    readable order without horizontal scrolling.

  - Added a reusable `dashboard-command-layout` that pairs the cockpit and
    attention queue on desktop and stacks cleanly on mobile.
  - Reused existing `command-focus`, `command-panel`, `operational-step`,
    `summary-card`, and `button-link` patterns instead of introducing a new UI
    system.
  - Tightened the dashboard health cards through a `health-grid` variant while
    preserving existing workspace, ClickUp, API, and Drive state wiring.
  - Validation passed: `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`,
    `git diff --check`, and `npm test` against disposable Postgres database
    `companycore_test` on port `55469`.
  - Local `/dashboard` Playwright smoke passed on desktop `1440x960` and mobile
    `390x844`: the command layout rendered once, attention queue stayed in the
    cockpit scan path, there were no console errors, and no horizontal
    overflow. Browser plugin validation was attempted first but remained
    blocked because its Node REPL requires Node `>=22.22.0` while this
    workstation exposes Node `22.13.0`.
