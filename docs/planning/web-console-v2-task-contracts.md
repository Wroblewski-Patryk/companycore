# Web Console V2 Task Contracts

## V2WEB-034 Command Bar Module Switcher Polish

- Task Type: design/frontend
- Current Stage: done
- Deliverable For This Stage: top command bar and module switcher use the same
  semantic lane model as the sidebar and expose clearer active-module context.
- Goal: Make cross-module navigation feel intentional and fast from every
  screen without changing route behavior or adding backend state.
- Scope:
  - `public/index.html`
  - `public/app.js`
  - `public/styles.css`
  - `docs/ux/design-memory.md`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
  - `docs/planning/web-console-v2-task-contracts.md`
- Implementation Plan:
  - Rename the topbar search affordance from "Open module" to "Jump to module",
    replace long workspace-name eyebrow text with stable current-module copy,
    and tighten route title styling.
  - Align module switcher groups with sidebar lanes: Command, Operate,
    Integrations, and Workspace.
  - Render grouped search results with group headings and active-module state.
  - Validate syntax, build, tests, and desktop/mobile command-bar rendering.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Module switcher results are grouped by the same job-family labels as the
    sidebar.
  - The current module is marked as selected in the switcher result list.
  - Enter-first-result navigation and click navigation keep using existing
    route paths.
  - Desktop and mobile topbar layouts render without horizontal overflow.
- Definition of Done:
  - `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm test` pass.
  - Local Playwright smoke verifies module search/open behavior on desktop and
    mobile with no console errors or horizontal overflow.
- Result Report:
  - Updated topbar copy to "Jump to module", changed the signed-in eyebrow to
    "Current module", and tightened route title chrome.
  - Aligned `moduleRoutes` groups to Command, Operate, Integrations, and
    Workspace.
  - Added grouped switcher result headings and active-result state while
    preserving the same navigation paths.
  - Validation passed: `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`,
    `git diff --check`, and `npm test` against disposable Postgres database
    `companycore_test` on port `55473`.
  - Local Playwright command-bar smoke passed on desktop `1440x960` and mobile
    `390x844`: "Jump to module" rendered, grouped results appeared, active
    Dashboard result was marked selected, Enter navigation opened API settings,
    there were no console errors, and no horizontal overflow. Browser plugin
    validation was attempted first but remained blocked because its Node REPL
    requires Node `>=22.22.0` while this workstation exposes Node `22.13.0`.

## V2WEB-033 App Shell Navigation Polish

- Task Type: design/frontend
- Current Stage: done
- Deliverable For This Stage: owner console navigation is grouped into
  command, operate, integration, and workspace lanes without changing route
  behavior.
- Goal: Make the application shell feel like a usable operating center across
  all screens by reducing sidebar scanning cost and making active navigation
  state clearer.
- Scope:
  - `public/index.html`
  - `public/styles.css`
  - `docs/ux/design-memory.md`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
  - `docs/planning/web-console-v2-task-contracts.md`
- Implementation Plan:
  - Group existing sidebar routes into semantic sections while preserving all
    hrefs and `data-nav` attributes.
  - Improve active, hover, and scroll behavior through shared sidebar styles.
  - Keep mobile drawer behavior compatible with the existing menu button.
  - Validate syntax, build, tests, and desktop/mobile navigation rendering.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Sidebar links are grouped by operational purpose.
  - Existing route navigation and active-route highlighting still work.
  - Sidebar can scroll independently when viewport height is constrained.
  - Mobile drawer remains usable with no horizontal overflow.
- Definition of Done:
  - `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm test` pass.
  - Local Playwright smoke verifies `/dashboard` shell rendering on desktop and
    mobile with no console errors or horizontal overflow.
- Result Report:
  - Grouped sidebar navigation into Command, Operate, Integrations, and
    Workspace sections.
  - Added reusable sidebar-section styling, clearer active route affordance,
    hover border, and independent sidebar scrolling.
  - Preserved all route URLs, `data-link`, and `data-nav` attributes.
  - Validation passed: `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`,
    `git diff --check`, and `npm test` against disposable Postgres database
    `companycore_test` on port `55471`.
  - Local `/dashboard` Playwright shell smoke passed on desktop `1440x960` and
    mobile `390x844`: four sidebar groups rendered, active dashboard route was
    preserved, there were no console errors, and no horizontal overflow.
    Browser plugin validation was attempted first but remained blocked because
    its Node REPL requires Node `>=22.22.0` while this workstation exposes Node
    `22.13.0`.

## V2WEB-032 Dashboard Command Layout Polish

- Task Type: design/frontend
- Current Stage: done
- Deliverable For This Stage: dashboard first viewport behaves more like an
  operational command center by pairing priority, readiness lanes, and the
  attention queue in one scan path.
- Goal: Make the owner console dashboard answer "what matters now, what is
  blocked, and where do I click next" faster without adding new backend
  behavior.
- Scope:
  - `public/index.html`
  - `public/styles.css`
  - `docs/ux/design-memory.md`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
  - `docs/planning/web-console-v2-task-contracts.md`
- Implementation Plan:
  - Place the operational cockpit and attention queue in a shared responsive
    dashboard command layout.
  - Keep readiness lanes inside the cockpit and move workspace/provider status
    cards into a tighter health strip.
  - Preserve existing IDs and JavaScript data wiring so dashboard behavior,
    links, and attention ranking remain unchanged.
  - Validate syntax, build, tests, and desktop/mobile dashboard render.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Desktop dashboard first viewport shows current priority, readiness lanes,
    and attention items side by side without layout overflow.
  - Mobile stacks the same cockpit, attention queue, and health strip in a
    readable order without horizontal scrolling.
  - Existing dashboard links and dynamic text still render from current state.
  - No new backend endpoints, tables, or placeholder-only data are introduced.
- Definition of Done:
  - `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm test` pass.
  - Local Playwright smoke verifies `/dashboard` on desktop and mobile with no
    console errors or horizontal overflow.
- Result Report:
  - Added a reusable `dashboard-command-layout` that pairs the cockpit and
    attention queue on desktop and stacks cleanly on mobile.
  - Reused existing `command-focus`, `command-panel`, `operational-step`,
    `summary-card`, and `button-link` patterns instead of introducing a new UI
    system.
  - Tightened the dashboard health cards through a `health-grid` variant while
    preserving existing workspace, ClickUp, API, and Drive state wiring.
  - Validation passed: `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`,
    `git diff --check`, and `npm test` against disposable Postgres database
    `companycore_test` on port `55469`.
  - Local `/dashboard` Playwright smoke passed on desktop `1440x960` and mobile
    `390x844`: the command layout rendered once, attention queue stayed in the
    cockpit scan path, there were no console errors, and no horizontal
    overflow. Browser plugin validation was attempted first but remained
    blocked because its Node REPL requires Node `>=22.22.0` while this
    workstation exposes Node `22.13.0`.

## V2WEB-031 Cross-Department Pipeline Semantics

- Task Type: product/frontend/docs
- Current Stage: done
- Deliverable For This Stage: owner console and source-of-truth docs describe
  pipelines as shared workflow infrastructure rather than a CRM-owned module.
- Goal: Keep CompanyCore domain language aligned with the product decision that
  CRM can use pipelines, but pipelines must be usable by every department.
- Scope:
  - `public/index.html`
  - `public/app.js`
  - `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`
  - `docs/API.md`

    routes, table names, and API contracts stable.
  - Record the confirmed domain boundary in architecture, API, database, UX,
    planning, task-board, and project-state docs.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - `/pipeline` no longer presents pipelines as CRM-owned.
  - CRM clients/deals/interactions remain visible as current consumers of the
    shared pipeline workbench.
  - No API route, database table, or persisted slug is renamed in this slice.
  - Validation covers frontend syntax, build, tests, and a browser smoke.
- Definition of Done:
  - `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and
    `npm test` pass.
  - Desktop and mobile `/pipeline` smoke confirm the corrected copy renders
    without console errors or horizontal overflow.

  - Reworded dashboard, module switcher, integration taxonomy, and `/pipeline`
    copy around shared pipeline infrastructure and current CRM usage records.
  - Moved Pipeline route search grouping and `pipeline-stages` catalog grouping
    from CRM to Workflow.
  - Updated architecture, API, database, UX, project-state, task-board, and
    next-commits docs with the cross-department pipeline decision.
  - Validation passed: `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`,
    `git diff --check`, and `npm test` against disposable Postgres database
    `companycore_test` on port `55466`.
  - Local `/pipeline` Playwright smoke passed on desktop `1440x960` and mobile
    `390x844`: corrected shared-workflow copy rendered, search input accepted
    text, there were no console errors, and no horizontal overflow. Browser
    plugin validation was attempted first but blocked because its Node REPL
    requires Node `>=22.22.0` while this workstation exposes Node `22.13.0`.

## V2WEB-020 Main Operating Area Foundation

- Result Report:
  - Added `main-general` / `00. Główny` as position `0` in the operating-area
    catalog.
  - Unclassified provider names now fall back to `main-general`; explicit
    operations and AI/Jarvis names still classify to their specific areas.
  - Existing workspaces receive the new area during `/v1/connection` and
    `/v1/operating-model` reads.
  - Updated frontend area metadata and copy from a strict 12-area model to
    `00` fallback plus 12 company departments.
