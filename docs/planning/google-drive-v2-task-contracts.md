- Definition of Done:
  - `npm run build`, `node --check public/app.js`, `git diff --check`, and
    authenticated Playwright smoke pass.
  - Canonical task, project-state, planning, and UX memory docs are updated.
- Result Report:
  - Added the authenticated `/data` Data Operations view.
  - Added 13 database module rows covering strategy, execution, CRM, knowledge,
    and AI operations tables.
  - Added reusable `workbench-*` CSS component classes for data-heavy index
    screens.
  - Added dashboard and module-switcher entry points for Data Operations.
  - Confirmed the frontend baseline remains static CSS; Tailwind and DaisyUI
    were not added because the project has no Tailwind build pipeline.

## V2WEB-025 Generic Table Record Workbench

- Task Type: frontend/ux
- Current Stage: done
- Deliverable For This Stage: read/inspect table workbench for CompanyCore
  database modules.

  - `docs/ux/design-memory.md`
- Implementation Plan:
  - Reuse the approved Data Operations index and `workbench-*` patterns.
  - Route every Data module to `/data/:table` and add a backend SPA route for
    `/data/:table`.
  - Render a split workbench with table stats, source/search filters, record
    list, selected-record inspector, field list, and raw JSON details.
  - Keep the slice read/inspect only; defer create/edit/archive controls to a
    later route-level editing task.
  - Validate desktop and mobile behavior with authenticated browser smoke.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Signed-in owners can open `/data/notes` and other supported table routes.
  - The workbench shows table label, group, description, operating-area mapping,
    record count, field count, API route count, and source count.
  - Record search and source filters update the list without page reload.
  - Selecting a record updates the inspector with readable field values and raw
    JSON.
  - `/data/:table` is served as an SPA route by the backend.
- Definition of Done:
  - `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `npm test`,
    `git diff --check`, and authenticated Playwright smoke pass.
  - Canonical task, project-state, planning, and UX memory docs are updated.
- Result Report:
  - Added `/data/:table` generic record workbench.
  - Data module rows now open table-specific routes.
  - Added reusable record list, selected state, inspector, field-list, and raw
    JSON presentation styles.
  - Added backend SPA route support for `/data/:table`.

  - Wire create, update, and archive actions to the existing Notes API
    (`POST /v1/notes`, `PATCH /v1/notes/:id`, `DELETE /v1/notes/:id`).
  - Refresh table records after each mutation and keep selected/draft state
    explicit.
  - Validate desktop and mobile rendered behavior with an authenticated browser
    smoke.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Signed-in owners can create a note from `/data/notes`.
  - Selecting a note loads its content into an editable textarea.
  - Saving updates the selected note and refreshes the record list/inspector.
  - Archiving a selected note calls the Notes archive API and shows archived
    status in the inspector.
  - The editor is not shown as a generic placeholder on unrelated tables.
- Definition of Done:
  - `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`, `npm test`,
    `git diff --check`, and authenticated Playwright desktop/mobile smoke pass.
  - Canonical task, project-state, planning, coverage-ledger, and UX memory
    docs are updated.
- Result Report:
  - Added a reusable `record-editor` presentation pattern.
  - Added typed note content create/save/archive controls inside `/data/notes`.
  - Added local editor status handling and validation for empty note content.

    Lists share the same workbench pattern while other modules remain
    read-only.
  - Added draft preservation for new task lists and fail-soft startup refresh
    handling so a transient workspace reload does not wipe operator input or
    sign the user out unless the error is actually auth-related.
  - Local validation passed: `node --check public/app.js`, `npm run build`,
    `git diff --check`, `npm test` against disposable Postgres on port
    `55462`, and authenticated Playwright desktop/mobile smoke that created,
    edited, archived, and reloaded real Task Lists API records.
  - Deployed to production at commit
    `eaad4fd3a0e12435e0906b73691b5de77a18a1b6`; production health and static
