# Google Drive V2 Task Contracts

This file is the execution queue for the approved Google Drive v2 integration.
It follows the repository task contract and must stay synchronized with
`.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md` and `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`.

## V2GD-011 Drive Setup Operator Instructions

- Task Type: frontend/documentation
- Current Stage: done
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Frontend Builder
- Priority: P2
- Iteration: current autonomous Drive follow-up
- Operation Mode: BUILDER
- Deliverable For This Stage: short owner-facing Google Drive API connection
  instructions in the existing `/settings/drive` setup panel.
- Process Self-Audit:
  - All seven autonomous loop steps are represented.
  - Exactly one small task is selected.
  - The task reuses the approved Google Drive setup surface.
- Goal: Help owners connect Google Drive APIs from the same UI surface that
  creates the OAuth URL and imports Drive folders.
- Scope:
  - `public/index.html`
  - `public/styles.css`
  - `docs/planning/google-drive-v2-task-contracts.md`
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- Implementation Plan:
  1. Add concise setup instructions above the Drive OAuth fields.
  2. Style the instructions using the existing panel language and spacing.
  3. Validate static markup, build, and rendered `/settings/drive` visibility.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - `/settings/drive` explains enabling Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets APIs.
  - `/settings/drive` tells owners to configure the OAuth redirect URI and
    backend OAuth env vars before consent/import.
  - The instruction remains readable on desktop and mobile widths.
- Definition of Done:
  - `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and rendered UI smoke pass or blockers
    are recorded.
  - No new Drive setup system, workaround, or duplicate configuration path is
    introduced.
- Result Report:
  - Added a compact setup checklist to the existing Google Drive setup panel.
  - Added lightweight checklist styles that wrap long environment variable
    names safely.

## V2GD-010 Drive Hierarchy Preview And Descriptions

- Task Type: feature
- Current Stage: done
- Status: DONE
- Owner: Backend Builder / Frontend Builder
- Priority: P1
- Iteration: current autonomous Drive follow-up
- Operation Mode: BUILDER
- Deliverable For This Stage: recursive Drive folder indexing, editable
  CompanyCore Drive descriptions, agent-visible API contract, and owner GUI
  preview controls.
- Process Self-Audit:
  - All seven autonomous loop steps are planned.
  - Exactly one priority task is selected.
  - The task reuses the approved Google Drive adapter and operating model.
- Goal: Let Jarvis, Paperclip, Aviary, and owners inspect imported Drive
  folder/file hierarchy, store a short description of what each item contains,
  and request on-demand content preview through CompanyCore instead of raw
  Google tokens.
- Scope:
  - `prisma/schema.prisma`
  - `prisma/migrations/*`
  - `src/integrations/google-drive/*`
  - `src/modules/google-drive/google-drive.routes.ts`
  - `src/auth/capabilities.ts`
  - `public/index.html`
  - `public/app.js`
  - `public/styles.css`
  - `src/tests/api.test.ts`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- Implementation Plan:
  1. Add an editable Drive record description field without exposing OAuth
     material.
  2. Make selected-folder import include selected root folders and nested
     folders/files so hierarchy is queryable from `parentExternalId`.
  3. Add a guarded API route for updating Drive file descriptions.
  4. Render imported Drive files as an indented hierarchy with preview and
     description edit controls in `/settings/drive`.
  5. Validate build, migration, API behavior, and rendered UI smoke.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Imported selected folders include their nested hierarchy, not only direct
    children.
  - `GET /v1/google-drive/files` returns descriptions and latest snapshots for
    agents.
  - `PATCH /v1/google-drive/files/:id/description` updates only workspace-owned
    Drive rows and is capability-protected.
  - `/settings/drive` shows hierarchy depth, latest description/summary, and
    on-demand preview for Docs, Sheets, images, draw.io/binary metadata.
- Definition of Done:
  - `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and relevant tests pass or blockers
    are recorded.
  - Documentation and context are updated.
  - No temporary Drive bypass, raw token exposure, or duplicate document system
    is introduced.
- Result Report:
  - Added editable `google_drive_files.description` persistence.
  - Added recursive selected-folder import that stores selected root folders,
    nested folders, and nested files while preserving parent hierarchy.
  - Added `PATCH /v1/google-drive/files/:id/description` with workspace
    ownership and capability enforcement.
  - Added `/settings/drive` hierarchy rendering with per-item description,
    latest snapshot summary, preview, edit, and Google open actions.
  - Verified `npm run build`, `node --check public/app.js`,
    `git diff --check`, and `npm test` against a disposable Postgres database.
  - Deployed commit `7f0e09078f6b9f54db641328ea3d75830c2d2b3d` to production
    with manual VPS backend rollover. Public and protected Google Drive smokes
    passed with Drive still unconfigured until owner OAuth consent/import.

    Drive metadata, Drive file creation, Drive changes/watch, Docs get/edit,
    and Sheets create/read/write behavior.
  - Google Drive was recorded as the next native adapter using the existing
    workspace settings, encrypted secrets, provider client, sync service,
    event inbox, and agent outbox pattern.
  - V2GD-002 through V2GD-006 were activated as the implementation queue.

- Current Stage: done
- Deliverable For This Stage: production runtime rollover and public/protected
  smoke evidence for the Google Drive v2 backend.
- Goal: Ensure production runs the Google Drive deploy-smoke and OAuth runtime
  hardening commits before operators enter Google Drive credentials.
- Scope:
  - Coolify/VPS backend runtime for `companycore`
  - `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- Implementation Plan:
  - Verify the deployed backend image and public health response.
  - Build the current commit as a new backend image with build metadata.
  - Roll over only the backend container on the existing application network.
  - Preserve the production Postgres container and rollback image.
  - Run public health/web/API smoke and protected Google Drive smoke.
  - Record release evidence without storing raw keys or provider tokens.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Production `/health` reports commit
    `a52afef4492445c87d1313324dcee8bbe82f3323`.
  - `prisma migrate deploy` reports no failed migration.
  - Postgres remains healthy.
  - Protected Google Drive smoke passes with an existing workspace service API
    key.
  - Raw API keys are not written to docs or chat.
- Definition of Done:
  - Public health, v1 health, web root, API metadata, protected connection,
    and Google Drive smoke are verified.
  - Deployment evidence is recorded in canonical docs.
- Result Report:
  - Diagnosed that the Coolify redeploy reached only
    `6731b82cd40866f3a06dc7b719cd7d13c269d5d5`, leaving the production health
    response without build metadata.
  - Built and deployed image
    `rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2_backend:a52afef4492445c87d1313324dcee8bbe82f3323`.
  - Started backend container
    `backend-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-manual-a52afef`.
  - Preserved `postgres-rnqqkhl3o3dut4qv56mlxly2-171327317813`, which remained
    healthy.
  - Verified `GET /health` and `GET /v1/health` return build commit
    `a52afef4492445c87d1313324dcee8bbe82f3323`.
  - Ran protected Google Drive smoke through the Jarvis workspace service API
    key. The smoke passed with `googleDriveConfigured=false`,
    `googleDriveActive=false`, and `importedFileCount=0`, which is expected
    before Google Drive credentials are entered.
