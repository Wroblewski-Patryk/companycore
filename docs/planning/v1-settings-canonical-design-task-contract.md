## Process Self-Audit
- [x] All seven autonomous loop steps are planned.
- [x] No loop step is being skipped.
- [x] Exactly one priority task is selected.
- [x] Operation mode matches the iteration number.
- [x] The task is aligned with repository source-of-truth documents.
- [x] `.agents/core/project-memory-index.md` was reviewed.
- [x] `.agents/core/mission-control.md` was considered for scope; this was a
      bounded planning task, not a long-running implementation mission.
- [x] Missing or template-like state tables were not needed for this design
      artifact.
- [x] Affected module confidence rows were identified.
- [x] Affected requirement, quality scenario, and risk rows were identified at
      planning level.
- [x] The task improves release confidence by producing canonical settings
      targets before V0 route cleanup.

## Mission Block
- Mission objective: create a canonical desktop and mobile visual target for
  the unified settings module.
- Release objective advanced: V1 web UX convergence and cleanup of V0 settings
  routes.
- Included slices: UX analysis, information architecture, desktop/mobile
  canonical images, planning spec.
- Explicit exclusions: no runtime React implementation, no backend contract
  changes, no route removal.
- Checkpoint cadence: single planning checkpoint.
- Stop conditions: architecture mismatch, blocked product decision, or
  inability to produce readable canonical images.
- Handoff expectation: future implementation can use the spec and images as
  the target for `/settings` route consolidation.

## Context

The V1 web view index marks `/settings`, `/settings/drive`, and
`/settings/integrations` as V0 rebuild surfaces. `/settings/api` and
`/react-agent-tools` are V1 foundations. The user requested one clean settings
module that exposes only the credentials needed to connect ClickUp, Google
Drive, Jarvis, Paperclip, and MCP. Sync, import, mapping, and review work are
out of scope for settings.

## Goal

Define and implement a canonical settings direction that exposes only the
credentials needed to connect tools: ClickUp API token, Google Drive OAuth
client credentials, Jarvis/Paperclip API key creation, and MCP endpoint fields.

## Scope

Allowed files:

- `docs/ux/v1-settings-canonical-spec-2026-05-15.md`
- `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-settings-canonical.html`
- `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-settings-desktop-canonical.png`
- `docs/ux/assets/companycore-v1-settings-mobile-canonical.png`
- `docs/ux/design-memory.md`
- `docs/ux/v1-web-view-index-2026-05-15.md`
- `web/src/main.tsx`
- `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`

## Implementation Plan
1. Inspect the V1 UX index, design system, existing canonical images, and
   current settings/agent routes.
2. Define a settings IA that supports humans and AI agents.
3. Produce deterministic desktop and mobile canonical images.
4. Record the route direction, layers, states, and implementation handoff.

## Autonomous Loop Evidence

### 1. Analyze Current State
- Issues: settings are split across provider-shaped V0 routes and separate
  V1 foundation surfaces.
- Gaps: no canonical unified settings UX target existed.
- Inconsistencies: ClickUp, Drive, API, and MCP appear as separate routes
  instead of a coherent owner/agent administration module.
- Architecture constraints: reuse React V1 shell, route registry, real
  backend contracts, and no fake provider data.

### 1a. Bootstrap Missing Project Knowledge
- Bootstrap needed: no
- Missing or template-like files: none for this planning scope
- Sources scanned: project state, task board, V1 web view index, design system,
  area detail spec, existing React settings routes.
- Rows created or corrected: none
- Assumptions recorded: settings should become one module with tab-aware entry
  points.
- Blocking unknowns: none for planning; implementation still needs exact route
  redirect behavior.
- Why it was safe to continue: the user clarified the settings product
  direction and requested the simple settings implementation direction.

### 2. Select One Priority Mission Objective
- Selected task: unified V1 settings canonical design.
- Priority rationale: it unblocks REACT-WEB-002, REACT-WEB-003, and future V0
  cleanup.
- Why other candidates were deferred: implementation would be premature before
  a canonical target exists.

### 3. Plan Implementation
- Files or surfaces to modify: UX spec, canonical assets, React settings route,
  planning and memory docs.
- Logic: route settings entry points to one minimal credential surface with
  Integrations, Agent keys, and MCP sections.
- Edge cases: mobile no-overflow, readable settings sections, and no sync,
  import, mapping, review queue, or large MCP catalog inside settings.

### 4. Execute Implementation
- Implementation notes: replaced the overloaded canonical mockup with a
  credentials-only target and routed the old settings entry points to a
  unified React settings surface.

### 5. Verify and Test
- Validation performed: rendered both images, visually inspected them, and ran
  the React web build.
- Result: desktop and mobile images are readable, intentionally sparse, and
  align with the V1 atlas shell direction. Browser proof confirmed the React
  route renders the required fields without desktop or mobile overflow.

### 6. Self-Review
- Simpler option considered: text-only IA without images.
- Technical debt introduced: no
- Scalability assessment: section model supports future integrations and
  external applications while keeping settings as a credential form.
- Refinements made: removed dashboard-style counters, sync lanes, import
  queues, mapping work, and dense review information from settings.

### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge
- Docs updated: UX spec and canonical assets.
- Context updated: V1 web view index, task board, design memory.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Desktop canonical image exists.
- [x] Mobile canonical image exists.
- [x] Spec explains sections, credential-only boundaries, AI access, MCP,
      and states.
- [x] Future implementation direction avoids ten disconnected settings views,
      one overloaded provider form, and settings-as-synchronization.

## Success Signal
- User or operator problem: settings feel scattered and too technical for
  owner and AI administration.
- Expected product or reliability outcome: one settings module can save
  provider credentials, create Jarvis/Paperclip API keys, and show MCP endpoint
  settings without hiding work views inside settings.
- How success will be observed: future implementation can replace V0 settings
  routes against these targets.
- Post-launch learning needed: yes
