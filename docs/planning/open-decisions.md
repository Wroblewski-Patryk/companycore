## Resolved Decisions

- 2026-05-02: CompanyCore v1 has no GUI.
- 2026-05-02: PostgreSQL is the source of truth.
- 2026-05-02: Backend API is the only supported access layer.
- 2026-05-02: CompanyCore v1 should include native direct ClickUp API
  integration as the first integration adapter. n8n is optional orchestration,
  not the required primary path.
- 2026-05-02: CompanyCore v1 should include a workspace ownership boundary.
  Registration creates an owner user and a workspace, and integration settings
  are assigned to the workspace.
- 2026-05-02: Owner authentication uses email/password with hashed password
  storage for v1. Token/session implementation details remain scoped to
  CCV1-012.
- 2026-05-02: v1 supports both owner-user auth for humans/API clients and
  hashed workspace-scoped service API keys for Paperclip, Jarvis, n8n, and
  other agents.
- 2026-05-02: v1 includes `workspace_memberships` now for future growth, but
  only the `owner` role is active. Invitations, non-owner roles, and advanced
  RBAC are deferred.
- 2026-05-02: Production deployments use `prisma migrate deploy` during backend
  startup. Local development may use `prisma migrate dev`; `db push` is not the
  production path.
- 2026-05-02: DEC-005 resolved. The smallest v1-native ClickUp slice is
  pull-only task sync from workspace-configured ClickUp lists into CompanyCore
  tasks. It does not write changes back to ClickUp in v1.
- 2026-05-02: DEC-001 resolved. v1 uses `/v1/*` route aliases without `/api`
  because the API already has a dedicated domain. Root routes remain available
  as compatibility aliases during v1.
- 2026-05-02: DEC-003 resolved. v1 adds minimal API routes only for
  `decisions` and `agent-logs`; task lists, pipeline stages, interactions, and
  agents remain deferred until workflows require them.
