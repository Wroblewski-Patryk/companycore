## Mission Block

- Mission objective: make Google Drive changes reconciliation first-run safe
  when a workspace has import coverage but no stored changes page token.
- Release objective advanced: Paperclip and CompanyCore can rely on a
  production-safe freshness baseline instead of manual-only import evidence.
- Included slices: backend reconcile behavior, API regression coverage, API and
  integration docs, production proof after deploy.
- Explicit exclusions: no raw Google token exposure, no direct database edits,
  no Paperclip runtime secret rotation, no Docs/Sheets write smoke.
- Checkpoint cadence: after implementation, after local validation, after
  production deploy/proof if available.
- Stop conditions: local tests fail, Google returns token/auth errors, or
  production cannot be updated safely from the current branch.
- Handoff expectation: record whether KI-009 is closed or remains deploy-gated.

## Context

PROD-GDRIVE-001 proved production selected-root Drive import and file indexing,
but `POST /v1/integration-settings/google_drive/changes/reconcile` returned
`422 sync_failed` because production had no stored `changesPageToken`.
The existing Google Drive client already supports Drive `changes/startPageToken`.

## Goal

The first reconciliation call must initialize a safe changes baseline when no
stored token exists, then later reconciliation calls must continue consuming
Drive `changes.list` from the stored token.

## Scope

- `src/integrations/google-drive/google-drive.sync.ts`
- `src/tests/api.test.ts`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- production verification through existing protected APIs after deploy

## Implementation Plan

1. Inspect the existing reconciliation contract and tests.
2. Add first-run baseline initialization using `GoogleDriveClient.getStartPageToken`.
3. Store the returned token in integration settings config.
4. Emit the existing `google_drive_changes_reconciled` event with
   `baselineInitialized=true` and zero processed changes.
5. Add API regression coverage that proves `changes.list` is not called during
   baseline initialization.
6. Update docs and state files.
7. Validate locally and, after deployment, run a production reconcile proof.

## Autonomous Loop Evidence

### 1. Analyze Current State

- Issues: production changes reconcile failed with `422 sync_failed`.
- Gaps: no stored changes page token after selected-root import.
- Inconsistencies: import works, but freshness polling cannot start itself.
- Architecture constraints: provider actions must remain action-shaped and
  use protected CompanyCore APIs only.

### 1a. Bootstrap Missing Project Knowledge

- Bootstrap needed: no.
- Sources scanned: Google Drive sync/client/auth code, API tests, integration
  docs, production audit contract.
- Rows created or corrected: pending.
- Assumptions recorded: safe to initialize a baseline because Drive
  `changes/startPageToken` is the official start point for future changes and
  does not mutate Google files.
- Blocking unknowns: none for local implementation; production closure depends
  on deployment.

### 2. Select One Priority Mission Objective

- Selected task: PROD-GDRIVE-002.
- Priority rationale: it directly addresses the production KI-009 follow-up
  found during the Drive/Paperclip audit.
- Why other candidates were deferred: broader V1 UI work can continue after
  the integration freshness baseline is safe.

### 3. Plan Implementation

- Files or surfaces to modify: Google Drive sync service, API regression test,
  API/integration docs, canonical state files.
- Logic: missing token -> get start page token -> store -> event -> zero-change
  result; existing token -> current changes.list flow.
- Edge cases: Google auth/provider errors still flow through existing
  `IntegrationError` handling.

### 4. Execute Implementation

- Implementation notes: `reconcileGoogleDriveChangesForWorkspace` now treats a
  missing stored `changesPageToken` as a first-run baseline case. It calls
  Drive `changes/startPageToken`, stores the returned token in the workspace
  Google Drive integration config, emits the existing
  `google_drive_changes_reconciled` event, and returns
  `baselineInitialized=true` with zero processed changes. The existing
  `changes.list` flow remains unchanged when a stored token exists.

### 5. Verify and Test

- Validation performed:
  - `npm run build:server`
  - `git diff --check`
  - `npm run test:api` with
    `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1:55490/postgres`
- Result: passed. The API regression suite now covers both the existing
  stored-token `changes.list` reconcile and the missing-token baseline path.
  The baseline test asserts that `changes.list` is not called while initializing
  the baseline token.

### 6. Self-Review

- Simpler option considered: documenting the production operator to run import
  only; rejected because it leaves the existing reconcile endpoint unable to
  bootstrap its own safe baseline.
- Technical debt introduced: no.
- Scalability assessment: uses the existing Drive client and integration
  setting config; no parallel freshness system.
- Refinements made: pending.

### 7. Update Documentation and Knowledge

- Docs updated: `docs/API.md`, `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`, this task contract.
- Context updated: `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
  `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `.agents/state/module-confidence-ledger.md`,
  `.agents/state/system-health.md`, `.agents/state/known-issues.md`,
  `.agents/state/next-steps.md`, `.agents/state/requirements-verification-matrix.md`,
  `.agents/state/quality-attribute-scenarios.md`,
  `.agents/state/risk-register.md`, and
  `.agents/core/project-memory-index.md`.
- Learning journal updated: not applicable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] If no stored `changesPageToken` exists, reconcile returns `200` with
  `baselineInitialized=true`, `processedCount=0`, and a stored
  `newStartPageToken`.
- [x] First-run baseline initialization does not call Drive `changes.list`.
- [x] Existing changes reconciliation with a stored token remains covered and
  still updates changed/removed records.
- [x] API and integration docs describe the first-run baseline behavior.
- [ ] Production proof after deploy shows reconcile no longer returns the
  previous `422 sync_failed` for the missing-token case, or the task records
  why deployment proof is still pending.

## Success Signal

- User or operator problem: Paperclip/CompanyCore freshness cannot rely on
  changes reconciliation when a workspace has no stored changes token.
- Expected product or reliability outcome: selected Drive roots can be imported
  and then placed on a safe future-change baseline through one reconcile call.
- How success will be observed: local API regression passes; production
  reconcile returns a baseline or normal reconcile result after deployment.
- Post-launch learning needed: yes.

## Deliverable For This Stage

  behavior

- [x] No existing functionality is broken.
- [x] Changes are documented in relevant source of truth.
- [x] Behavior is reproducible from the evidence recorded below.
- [x] `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` was checked before status changed to `REVIEW`.

## Stage Exit Criteria

  passed.
- Manual checks: production proof remains pending until deployment.
- Screenshots/logs: not applicable.
- High-risk checks: no raw Google OAuth tokens or API keys are returned or
  logged by the changed route; provider auth failures still use existing
  `IntegrationError` handling.
