# Auth, Workspace, And Integration Plan

CompanyCore v1 must secure company operations without becoming an overbuilt
enterprise tenant system. The target is a simple owner workspace:

```text
register owner -> create workspace -> authenticate -> configure integration
  -> sync external data into workspace-scoped CompanyCore records
```

## Design Intent

- A user owns a workspace.
- Registration creates the owner user and workspace atomically.
- Owner authentication uses email/password with hashed password storage for v1.
- Workspace memberships are included now for future growth, but v1 activates
  only the `owner` role.
- Business records belong to a workspace.
- Service API keys belong to a workspace and are intended for Paperclip,
  Jarvis, n8n, and other agents.
- Integration settings belong to a workspace.
- ClickUp is the first native integration adapter and should establish the
  pattern for future integrations.
- v1 does not include invitations, billing, advanced RBAC, organization admin
  UI, or full multi-tenant product workflows.

## Proposed v1 Data Model

Final schema names must be confirmed during CCV1-011, but the working target is:

- `users`
  - `id`
  - `email`
  - `password_hash`
  - `name`
  - `created_at`
  - `updated_at`

- `workspaces`
  - `id`
  - `name`
  - `owner_user_id`
  - `created_at`
  - `updated_at`

- `workspace_memberships`
  - Include now for future-proofing.
  - v1 activates only `owner`.

- `api_keys`
  - Existing table should become workspace-scoped.
  - Store hashed key material, not only plaintext.
  - Optional scopes can support agent/service boundaries.

- `integration_settings`
  - `id`
  - `workspace_id`
  - `provider`, for example `clickup`
  - encrypted or protected secret material
  - non-secret configuration JSON
  - `active`
  - `last_validated_at`
  - `created_at`
  - `updated_at`

- Business tables
  - Add `workspace_id` to projects, goals, targets, task lists, tasks, clients,
    deals, pipeline stages, interactions, notes, decisions, agents, agent logs,
    events, and future integration sync state where applicable.

## Auth Flow

Minimum API shape:

```http
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/login
GET /me
```

Registration must:

1. validate email and password or approved identity payload
2. create the user
3. create the workspace
4. assign the user as owner through `workspace_memberships`
5. return a safe auth response without secrets
6. emit `workspace_created` and `user_registered` or equivalent events if event
   scope is approved

Login must:

1. verify credentials fail-closed
2. return an auth token/session or approved auth context
3. include enough safe context for clients to know the active workspace

Protected requests must:

1. authenticate user session/token or workspace API key
2. resolve `workspaceId`
3. reject requests without a workspace
4. filter reads and writes by `workspaceId`
5. avoid leaking whether records exist in another workspace

## Service API Keys

API keys are still useful for Paperclip, Jarvis, n8n, and other agents. They
should not remain global.

v1 service key target:

- key belongs to one workspace
- key is hashed at rest
- key can be active/inactive
- optional scopes are supported or explicitly deferred with schema room
- middleware resolves `workspaceId`
- `last_used_at` updates safely
- raw key is only shown once at creation if a creation endpoint is added

## Workspace-Scoped ClickUp Settings

ClickUp settings should be stored under the workspace, not in global env except
for encryption/app secrets.

Minimum ClickUp config:

- ClickUp API token or approved OAuth token material
- team ID if needed
- list IDs, folder IDs, or space IDs selected for sync
- sync mode: recommended v1 is read-only discovery plus pull sync
- active flag

Recommended first ClickUp slice:

1. Read-only discovery endpoint for workspace owner/Jarvis:
   - list teams/spaces/folders/lists/tasks available from the configured token
2. Pull-only sync from selected list IDs into CompanyCore tasks:
   - no write-back to ClickUp in first slice
   - upsert by `(workspace_id, source = clickup, external_id)`
   - emit `task_synced_from_clickup`

Write-back to ClickUp should be planned later after the read/pull path is
verified.

## Required Safety Rules

- No integration token may be hardcoded.
- No integration token may be logged.
- No integration token may be returned in API responses.
- Cross-workspace access must fail closed.
- Provider errors should return safe, actionable error codes.
- Sync must not corrupt existing tasks when ClickUp is unavailable.
- External IDs must be unique per workspace and source, not globally.

## Resolved Architecture Choices For v1

- Use email/password for owner registration/login.
- Store password hashes, never plaintext passwords.
- Include `workspace_memberships` now, but only use `owner` in v1.
- Support both owner auth and workspace-scoped service API keys.
- Treat service API keys as credentials for agents and automation clients.
- Defer invitations, non-owner roles, and advanced RBAC.

## Implementation Order

1. CCV1-001: align canonical docs with workspace/auth/native ClickUp direction.
2. CCV1-011: finalize workspace/auth architecture contract.
3. CCV1-003: create migration baseline and migration policy.
4. CCV1-012: implement registration, login, workspace bootstrap.
5. CCV1-013: implement workspace integration settings and secret storage.
6. CCV1-007: harden workspace-scoped API keys.
7. CCV1-010: implement ClickUp read-only discovery and pull sync.
8. CCV1-006: add endpoint and auth/integration tests.
9. CCV1-009: verify production deployment and record smoke evidence.
