# V1 Department Systems Global Implementation Plan

Last updated: 2026-05-16

## Purpose

This plan turns the accepted department-management-system architecture into an
execution queue for CompanyCore V1 web, backend, and Paperclip integration.

Architecture inputs:

- `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-v1-blueprint.md`
- `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/companycore-business-module-map.md`
- `docs/architecture/companycore-global-business-flow.md`
- `docs/architecture/organizational-architecture-bridge.md`
- `docs/ux/v1-department-management-systems-view-map.md`

The goal is a coherent minimal V1 where:

- `00 Main` receives and routes unclassified work;
- each of the 12 departments has a management system shell;
- Paperclip can inspect context, propose work, and report evidence through
  CompanyCore boundaries;
- the owner can react to Paperclip background output;
- pricing, discounts, current client work, archived clients, and feedback
  learning are visible before high-risk automation;
- backend read models are stable before write actions expand.

## V1 Success Definition

CompanyCore V1 department systems are minimally working when:

1. The owner can open `00 Main` and see unclassified owner/client/provider/AI
   inputs that need routing or approval.
2. The owner can open each department and understand purpose, current health,
   connected records/files/tasks/workflows, agent readiness, and next action.
3. Paperclip can read a department packet for `00`-`12` through HTTP/MCP
   boundaries without direct database or provider-token access.
4. Paperclip-created or proposed background work appears in a review queue
   before it affects the company.
5. Sales/Finance can represent price-list context, hourly-value assumptions,
   discounts including 100 percent discounts, invoice readiness, and current
   client work as evidence-backed data.
6. Old clients can be imported or classified as archive evidence for learning.
7. Feedback and retros can create improvement tasks or standards/process
   updates.
8. High-risk writes remain approval-aware, audited, and fail-closed.

## Execution Rules

- Build read models before write models.
- Keep each task small enough to commit and revert.
- Update task board, requirement matrix, delivery map, module confidence, and
  relevant architecture/UX docs when a task changes product truth.
- Use existing CompanyCore tables, tasks, pipelines, Drive files, knowledge,
  resources, decisions, approvals, risks, controls, agents, MCP, and audit
  first.
- Do not add fake data to make a department look complete.
- Do not let Paperclip bypass CompanyCore APIs/MCP tools.
- Do not add invoice/payment, legal, paid-ad, or autonomous pricing writes
  until contracts and guardrails exist.

## Wave 0 - Program Planning And Alignment

## Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12 systems become 12 disconnected apps | High | Shared shell, shared packet, shared backend modules. |
| Paperclip output becomes invisible background work | High | `00 Main` intake/review queue before broader automation. |
| Pricing automation happens before price sources are reliable | High | Read-only pricing/hourly/discount context before writes. |
| Old clients stay outside learning loop | Medium | Archived-client import/classification before improvement automation. |
| Department health becomes vanity status | Medium | Health must connect to blockers, tasks, evidence, approvals, and risks. |
| Finance/legal/ads writes become unsafe | High | Explicit security/governance contracts before commands. |
| Backend schema expands too early | Medium | Read models and audits before migrations. |
