# API

All endpoints except `GET /health`, `POST /auth/register`, and
`POST /auth/login` require one supported auth mechanism:

```text
X-API-Key: dev-companycore-key
```

```text
Authorization: Bearer <owner-auth-token>
```

Base URL in local Docker:

```text
http://localhost:3102
```

The owner console is served from `/`. It includes owner login, API key
management, ClickUp setup and sync, Google Drive setup, operating-area review,
relationship mapping, data operations, and typed business editors. Agents,
automations, future dashboards, and future mobile clients should still use the
HTTP API as the supported integration layer.

v1 routes are available under `/v1/*` without an `/api` prefix because the API
uses a dedicated API domain in production. Root-level routes remain as v1
compatibility aliases.

## Response Contract

CompanyCore v1 should use stable response envelopes so Paperclip, Jarvis,
future GUI clients, and tests can rely on predictable shapes.

Successful single-resource responses:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

Successful list responses:

```json
{
  "data": []
}
```

Future pagination may add `meta`, but existing clients should not require it
until the endpoint documents pagination explicitly.

Error responses:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "Request validation failed.",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `error.code` is stable and testable.
- `error.message` is safe for API clients and operators.
- `error.details` is optional and must not include secrets.
- Raw Prisma, provider, stack trace, token, password, API key, or validation
  internals must not be returned directly.
- Protected endpoints should not reveal whether another workspace's record
  exists.

## Workspace Guardrail Contract

Every protected workspace-scoped endpoint must follow these API rules:

- derive `workspaceId` from auth context or service API key
- ignore or reject client attempts to set `workspaceId` directly unless an
  endpoint explicitly documents a safe bootstrap exception
- list only active workspace records
- reject foreign relation IDs from another workspace
- return `not_found` or `forbidden` for cross-workspace record access without
  leaking whether the record exists
- return `workspace_required` when auth succeeds but no workspace can be
  resolved
- never return integration secret values

Implemented v1 workspace-scoped record surfaces:

- projects, goals, targets, tasks, clients, deals, notes, decisions,
  agent logs, and events derive `workspaceId` from the auth context.
- relation IDs such as `projectId`, `goalId`, `clientId`, `dealId`, and
  `taskId` are accepted only when the related record belongs to the active
  workspace.
- attempts to attach a record to another workspace return `not_found`.

## Standard Error Codes

| HTTP | Code | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `validation_error` | Request body, params, or query failed validation. |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | No valid user auth or service API key was provided. |
| 403 | `forbidden` | Authenticated caller cannot perform the action. |
| 404 | `not_found` | Record is missing or not visible to the active workspace. |
| 409 | `conflict` | Unique constraint or state conflict. |
| 422 | `workspace_required` | Request cannot resolve an active workspace. |
| 422 | `integration_not_configured` | Workspace lacks required provider settings. |
| 400 | `integration_secret_required` | New provider setting was created without required token material. |
| 401 | `integration_invalid_token` | External provider rejected submitted or stored token material. |
| 429 | `integration_rate_limited` | External provider rate limit was reached. |
| 502 | `integration_unavailable` | External provider is unavailable or returned an unsafe response. |
| 500 | `sync_failed` | Sync failed after request validation and provider call handling. |
| 500 | `internal_server_error` | Unexpected server error with no safe specific code. |

Implementation should map framework/provider/database errors into this contract
instead of exposing raw errors.

## Auth And Workspace

v1 must add owner registration/login before workspace-owned settings are
production-ready. Registration should create an owner user and workspace in one
transaction. Protected business and integration routes should resolve an active
`workspaceId` from either a user auth context or a workspace-scoped service API
key.

Approved v1 auth direction:

- Human owner auth uses email/password with hashed password storage.
- Registration creates the owner user, workspace, and owner membership
  atomically.
- Workspace memberships are included in the data model, but v1 only activates
  the `owner` role.
- Agent/service access uses workspace-scoped hashed API keys.
- Protected routes must accept a valid owner auth context or workspace service
  API key and resolve `workspaceId`.
- Requests without a resolvable workspace fail closed.

Implemented minimum:

```http
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/login
GET /auth/me
```

Planned registration payload:

```json
{
  "email": "owner@example.com",
  "password": "strong-password",
  "name": "Owner Name",
  "workspaceName": "LuckySparrow"
}
```

Safe auth responses may include user and workspace identifiers, but must not
include password hashes, raw API keys, integration tokens, or secret material.

Integration settings such as ClickUp credentials must belong to the active
workspace and must not be returned in API responses.

## Service API Keys

`X-API-Key` remains the service-client auth mechanism for Paperclip, Jarvis,
n8n, and other agents. In v1 it must become workspace-scoped:

- API key resolves exactly one workspace.
- API key material is stored hashed.
- Existing plaintext-key rows are accepted only as a transition path when
  `key_hash` is not populated yet.
- Inactive keys fail closed.
- Service-key scopes are enforced against route capabilities. A scoped key can
  call only routes whose capability appears in its `scopes` array.
- Empty scopes, `*`, `companycore:*`, and legacy `adapter:*` scopes currently
  retain broad compatibility for already deployed Jarvis/Paperclip-style
  agents. New keys should use explicit route capabilities.
- Raw keys are only shown once if an API key creation endpoint is added.

Owner-managed adapter keys:

```http
GET /v1/api-keys
GET /v1/api-keys/profiles
POST /v1/api-keys
PATCH /v1/api-keys/:id
GET /api-keys
GET /api-keys/profiles
POST /api-keys
PATCH /api-keys/:id
```

The owner console loads `GET /v1/api-keys/profiles` as the canonical source
for MCP agent key presets. Static frontend presets are only a signed-out or
profile-load fallback.

`POST /v1/api-keys` is owner-only and returns the raw API key exactly once:

```json
{
  "name": "MCP Company OS reader",
  "profileId": "mcp_company_os_reader"
}
```

Safe response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Jarvan adapter",
    "keyPrefix": "cc_v1_abcd",
    "key": "cc_v1_generated-secret-shown-once",
    "active": true
  }
}
```

List and update responses never include `key`. `PATCH /v1/api-keys/:id`
currently supports `{ "active": false }` or `{ "active": true }`.

Owner console support:

- `/settings/api` includes the guided Agent service keys panel.
- New keys should be created from the least-privilege preset that matches the
  agent role, then adjusted only when the connection manifest proves another
  capability is required.
- Raw key material is displayed only immediately after creation. Refreshing the
  page or dismissing the one-time panel leaves only the safe key prefix.
- Rotation is performed by creating a replacement key with the same scopes,
  copying the new raw key once, and deactivating the previous key.

## Integration Settings

Workspace-owned integration settings are configured through protected routes.
The active `workspaceId` is derived from bearer auth or `X-API-Key`; clients do
not send `workspaceId`.

```http
GET /integration-settings/clickup
PUT /integration-settings/clickup
POST /v1/integration-settings/clickup/discover
GET /v1/integration-settings/clickup/webhooks
POST /v1/integration-settings/clickup/webhooks/reconcile
DELETE /v1/integration-settings/clickup/webhooks/:id
GET /v1/integration-settings/clickup/events
POST /v1/integration-settings/clickup/events/retry-failed
POST /v1/integration-settings/clickup/maintenance/run
```

ClickUp configuration payload:

```json
{
  "token": "clickup-api-token",
  "config": {
    "teamId": "clickup-team-id",
    "spaceIds": ["clickup-space-id"],
    "folderIds": ["clickup-folder-id"],
    "listIds": ["clickup-list-id"],
    "syncMode": "two_way",
    "importMode": "merge"
  },
  "active": true
}
```

Safe responses include only metadata and non-secret config:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "provider": "clickup",
    "workspaceId": "uuid",
    "config": {
      "listIds": ["clickup-list-id"],
      "syncMode": "pull",
      "importMode": "merge"
    },
    "active": true,
    "secretConfigured": true
  }
}
```

`token` is encrypted before storage and is never returned. Updating config
without a `token` preserves the existing encrypted secret. Creating a new
setting requires a token.

The owner console uses discovery before saving settings so humans do not need
to manually look up ClickUp IDs. Discovery is owner-auth only and never stores
the submitted token:

```json
{
  "token": "clickup-api-token",
  "teamId": "optional-clickup-workspace-id",
  "useStoredToken": false
}
```

If `teamId` is omitted, discovery returns ClickUp Workspaces available to the
token. If `teamId` is provided, discovery also returns Spaces, Folders,
folderless Lists, and folder Lists for that ClickUp Workspace. If
`useStoredToken` is true, CompanyCore uses the encrypted workspace ClickUp
token and still does not return it to the browser.

When discovery includes a selected `teamId`, CompanyCore also persists safe
ClickUp structural metadata into the operating model registry:

- ClickUp Workspace as an external container mapping.
- ClickUp Spaces mapped to operating areas.
- ClickUp Folders mapped to operating folders.
- ClickUp Lists mapped to operating tables.

This persistence is idempotent and stores provider IDs/names only, not token
material.

Webhook reconciliation compares CompanyCore registrations with ClickUp's remote
webhook list, creates missing selected List webhooks, refreshes health metadata,
reactivates inactive remote webhooks when possible, replaces registrations that
no longer exist in ClickUp, and marks registrations for no-longer-selected
Lists inactive. Owner users can delete a single registration through
`DELETE /v1/integration-settings/clickup/webhooks/:id`, which first deletes the
remote ClickUp webhook and then removes the local encrypted registration.

Provider event inbox health is exposed without returning raw webhook payloads:

```http
GET /v1/integration-settings/clickup/events?status=failed
POST /v1/integration-settings/clickup/events/retry-failed
```

`GET /clickup/events` returns safe metadata such as event name, external task
ID, processing status, retry count, last error code, and timestamps. Owner users
can replay failed events with:

```json
{
  "eventIds": ["provider-event-uuid"],
  "limit": 25
}
```

Replay reprocesses failed inbox rows through the same ClickUp task/comment
mapper, clears `lastErrorCode` on success, and leaves still-failing rows in
`failed` state with an incremented retry count.

`POST /clickup/maintenance/run` is the canonical continuous-sync fallback for
agents or operators. It performs, in order:

- webhook registration reconciliation and health refresh
- failed provider-event replay
- non-destructive ClickUp task pull using `merge` by default

The endpoint accepts a limited import mode override:

```json
{
  "importMode": "merge"
}
```

Allowed maintenance modes are `merge`, `skip_existing`, and `inspect_only`.
`replace_selected_lists` is intentionally excluded from maintenance because it
is a destructive first-run/import-repair policy, not an always-on freshness
operation.

The backend also runs this maintenance flow automatically for active ClickUp
workspace settings when `COMPANYCORE_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is configured. The
default cadence is 15 minutes and can be changed with
`CLICKUP_MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`; values below 5 minutes are clamped to 5
minutes. Scheduled maintenance always uses `merge` so it refreshes ClickUp-owned
records without deleting native CompanyCore records.

Safe discovery response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "workspaces": [
      {
        "id": "clickup-workspace-id",
        "name": "LuckySparrow"
      }
    ],
    "selectedWorkspace": {
      "id": "clickup-workspace-id",
      "name": "LuckySparrow"
    },

            "id": "folderless-list-id",

          }
        ],
        "folders": [
          {
            "id": "folder-id",
            "name": "Company",

              {
                "id": "list-id",
                "name": "Jarvis"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Health

```http
GET /health

Adapters should call this endpoint first to verify that their workspace API key
is valid and to discover safe v1 capabilities.

The `adapterManifest` is the machine-readable v1 onboarding surface for
Paperclip, Jarvis, Jarvan, Aviary, n8n, and similar clients. It lists canonical
paths, methods, expected capabilities, payload field hints, safe error
behavior, and write rules without exposing secrets. `data.capabilities` is
filtered to the authenticated key's effective capabilities unless the key is in
documented broad compatibility mode.

`data.mcpManifest` is the MCP-friendly projection of the same route contract.
It is not a direct database protocol. MCP servers should wrap the advertised
HTTP routes as tools and preserve CompanyCore authentication, workspace
scoping, validation, approval, event, and audit behavior.

## MCP Manifest

MCP clients and bridge servers can read a filtered tool catalog directly:

```http
GET /v1/mcp/manifest
GET /mcp/manifest
```

## Commercial Exceptions

`GET /v1/commercial-exceptions` is the protected read-only Sales/Finance
view for discounts, pro-bono work, and commercial exceptions before any
quote, discount, invoice, payment, or final-term write command exists.

Supported query parameters:

- `clientId`
- `dealId`
- `status`
- `exceptionType`
- `risk`
- `includeArchived`
- `limit`

The endpoint derives a workspace-scoped packet from existing approvals,
decisions, deals, tasks, notes, interactions, risks, and agent events. It
returns gross value, discount percent/value, final value, reason category,
approval state, risk flags, invoice-readiness state, source references,
allowed review actions, and blocked high-risk actions.

Read guarantees:

- no source records are mutated on read
- foreign workspace sources are not visible
- `100%` discounts are represented as commercial exceptions, not as missing
  revenue
- missing client, gross value, reason, or approval evidence is surfaced as
  `needs_source` or `needs_owner_decision`
- agents may review or propose follow-up work, but may not apply discounts,
  send invoices, mark payments, or quote final terms from this endpoint

## Finance Context

`GET /v1/finance/context` is the protected read-only Finance and Billing
packet for candidate pricing models, hourly-value assumptions, work valuation,
commercial exceptions, invoice-readiness blockers, payment context, risks,
source conflicts, and Paperclip-safe owner-decision prompts.

Supported query parameters:

- `clientId`
- `dealId`
- `market`
- `status`
- `includeArchived`
- `limit`

Read guarantees:

- no pricing policy, discount, invoice, payment, deal, task, approval, note, or
  agent-event source is mutated on read
- conflicting price models remain `needs_owner_decision`
- the `150 CHF/hour` assumption remains a candidate until confirmed
- `100%` discounts are included from the commercial exception read model
- Finance and Paperclip get explicit blocked actions for active price policy,
  final quote, discount application, invoice sending, and payment status writes

            }
          },
          "required": []
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Owners can also create a least-privilege MCP key from a canonical profile:

```json
{
  "name": "MCP Company OS reader",
  "profileId": "mcp_company_os_reader"
}
```

If `scopes` is provided with `profileId`, the explicit scopes are used. If
`scopes` is omitted, CompanyCore uses the selected profile's scopes.

Implemented MCP-oriented profiles:

| Profile | Risk | Intended use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mcp_company_os_reader` | low | Read-only Company OS, operating model, and event context. |
| `mcp_knowledge_reader` | low | Read-only notes, decisions, Drive files, and Company OS knowledge context. |
| `mcp_memory_writer` | medium | Write notes, decisions, and agent logs while reading company context. |
| `mcp_event_worker` | medium | Read and acknowledge assigned agent events, then report logs. |
| `mcp_operator` | high | Human-supervised operational agent with broad business write and safe integration lifecycle scopes. |

The returned tools are filtered by the authenticated key's effective
capabilities. A scoped key with only `mcp:read` and `company-os:read` will see
Company OS read tools, but not note-writing, Drive-writing, integration
maintenance, or destructive lifecycle tools.

MCP direction:

- CompanyCore remains the source of truth and policy/audit boundary.
- MCP is the preferred agent tool interface above the HTTP API.
- MCP servers should be thin bridge processes that call CompanyCore routes.
- MCP tools must never bypass the API by reading PostgreSQL or provider tokens
  directly.
- Future risky tools should become explicit lifecycle actions with approval
  requirements before autonomous MCP use.
- Tools marked `requiresApproval` are supervised-only by design until the
  bridge guard in `docs/operations/approval-aware-mcp-command-flow.md` is
  implemented and validated.

The first local stdio bridge is available as:

```bash
npm run mcp:server
```

It reads `COMPANYCORE_BASE_URL` and `COMPANYCORE_API_KEY`, discovers tools from
`/v1/mcp/manifest`, implements `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, and
`tools/call`, and calls CompanyCore HTTP routes on behalf of the MCP client.
The repeatable smoke command is:

```bash
npm run mcp:smoke
```

Operational setup and smoke instructions live in
`docs/operations/companycore-mcp-bridge.md`. Runtime setup snippets for Codex,
Paperclip, and generic MCP-compatible agents live in
`docs/operations/mcp-agent-runtime-setup.md`.

## Relationship Graph

```http
GET /v1/relationships/graph
GET /relationships/graph
```

Required capability:

```text
relationships:read
```

Returns a workspace-scoped read-only relationship graph for the owner web
console and MCP bridge. The endpoint derives all nodes and edges from existing
workspace records; it does not create links, mutate scope, or use a generic
relationship edge table.

Query:

| Name | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `limit` | number | `200` | Optional per-family read cap from `1` to `500` for high-volume graph families such as Drive files and provider mappings. |

      },
      "limit": 200
    }
  }
}
```

Confidence values:

- `direct`: database FK or direct relation field.
- `provider_hierarchy`: provider external IDs and stored parent metadata.
- `route_inferred`: operating-table `apiSlug` to workspace route/collection.
- `needs_review`: represented in `reviewItems` when an assignment is missing
  or ambiguous.
- `unsupported`: represented in `unsupportedFamilies` when the schema or read
  contract cannot support a useful relationship without inventing data.

## Area Operating Graph

```http
GET /v1/operating-graph/areas/:areaKey
GET /operating-graph/areas/:areaKey
```

Required capability:

```text
operating-graph:read
```

Returns a workspace-scoped read-only operating graph for one selected company
department. The route accepts backend operating area keys such as
`strategy-governance` and canonical V1 UX keys such as `01-strategia`.

The endpoint derives graph nodes from existing records only. It does not create
fake goals, mutate links, or expose a generic edge editor.

Query:

| Name | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `limit` | number | `100` | Optional per-family read cap from `1` to `500`. |
| `include` | string | none | Reserved for future layer filtering; currently accepted for compatibility. |

Response shape:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "area": {
      "id": "area-id",
      "key": "strategy-governance",
      "canonicalKey": "01-strategia",

            "field": "goalId",
            "value": "goal-id"
          }
        ]

      "sources": []
    },
    "gaps": [],
    "reviewItems": [],
    "unsupportedFamilies": []
  }
}
```

Edge confidence values:

- `direct`: a durable database field connects the records.
- `route_inferred`: an operating table or runtime field implies the relation.
- `provider_hierarchy`: a provider hierarchy such as Google Drive parent/child.
- `content_inferred`: content or metadata implies a relation.
- `needs_review`: the owner should confirm or assign scope.
- `unsupported`: the relation family is known but not modeled as a fact.

## Company OS

Company OS records are exposed through a mostly read-oriented,
workspace-scoped API surface for dashboards, agents, and future workbenches.
Collection reads are guarded by `company-os:read`. Runtime writes remain
command-oriented. Low-risk Class A definition edits are exposed only through
explicit audited routes, starting with `standards`.

```http
GET /v1/company-os
GET /v1/company-os/:collection
GET /v1/company-os/:collection/:id
GET /company-os
GET /company-os/:collection
GET /company-os/:collection/:id
```

`GET /v1/company-os` returns a cockpit snapshot:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "service": "company-os",
    "workspaceId": "uuid",
    "counts": {
      "definitions": {
        "processes": 1,
        "pipelines": 7,
        "pipelineStages": 60,
        "procedures": 7,
        "toolAdapters": 2
      },
      "runtime": {
        "pipelineRuns": 1,
        "stageRuns": 1,
        "approvals": 1,
        "auditLogs": 1,
        "events": 12
      },
      "governance": {
        "policies": 1,
        "risks": 1,
        "controls": 1,
        "automationRules": 1,
        "businessFunctions": 12
      }
    },
    "attention": {
      "pendingApprovals": [],
      "blockedPipelineRuns": [],
      "failedStageRuns": [],
      "highRisks": [],
      "unhealthyAdapters": []
    },
    "recent": {
      "pipelineRuns": [],
      "approvals": [],
      "auditLogs": [],
      "events": []
    },
    "collections": ["processes", "pipelines", "approvals"]
  }
}
```

Allowed collections:

- `processes`
- `pipelines`
- `pipeline-stages`
- `procedures`
- `procedure-steps`
- `company-roles`
- `resources`
- `tool-adapters`
- `integration-capabilities`
- `standards`
- `pipeline-runs`
- `stage-runs`
- `approvals`
- `checklist-templates`
- `checklist-items`
- `acceptance-criteria`
- `audit-logs`
- `policies`
- `metrics`
- `risks`
- `controls`
- `knowledge-items`
- `decision-logs`
- `automation-rules`
- `triggers`
- `artifacts`
- `dependencies`
- `business-functions`
- `stakeholders`

List routes accept an optional `limit` query parameter from `1` to `100`.
Invalid collection names return `validation_error`; missing records return
`not_found` without leaking cross-workspace existence.

### Company OS Standard Definition Commands

The first Class A definition write contract is an audited `standards` surface.
It is intentionally narrower than a raw Company OS table editor.

```http
POST /v1/company-os/standards
PATCH /v1/company-os/standards/:id
DELETE /v1/company-os/standards/:id
```

Required capability:

```text
company-os:definition:write
```

Create body:

```json
{
  "name": "UX evidence standard",
  "category": "ux",
  "description": "Every user-facing Company OS surface needs evidence-backed recovery states.",
  "checklistId": "uuid",
  "validationMethod": "Browser proof, accessibility pass, and task evidence.",
  "ownerRoleId": "uuid",
  "status": "active"
}
```

Behavior:

- derive workspace from auth
- validate optional `ownerRoleId` and `checklistId` inside the same workspace
- create or update only `standards`
- archive standards through `DELETE` by setting `status` to `archived`
- emit `standard_created`, `standard_updated`, or `standard_archived`
- append `standard.created`, `standard.updated`, or `standard.archived` audit
  evidence with a correlation ID
- keep workflow definitions, governance definitions, automation definitions,
  and runtime evidence out of this low-risk editor contract

`POST` and `PATCH` appear as MCP write tools when the caller has
`company-os:definition:write`. `DELETE` appears as a destructive MCP tool and
requires explicit approval/supervision.

### Company OS Workflow Definition Draft Commands

Workflow definitions use a draft and impact-preview command surface instead
of raw CRUD over active processes, pipelines, procedures, stages, or procedure
steps.

```http
GET /v1/company-os/workflow-definitions/drafts
GET /v1/company-os/workflow-definitions/drafts/:id
POST /v1/company-os/workflow-definitions/drafts
PATCH /v1/company-os/workflow-definitions/drafts/:id
POST /v1/company-os/workflow-definitions/drafts/:id/actions/preview-impact
POST /v1/company-os/workflow-definitions/drafts/:id/actions/activate
```

Required capability:

```text
company-os:workflow-definition:write
```

Activation requires:

```text
company-os:workflow-definition:activate
```

Create body:

```json
{
  "rootObjectType": "pipeline",
  "rootObjectId": "uuid",
  "name": "Client Onboarding Pipeline v2",
  "reason": "Add evidence preview before changing active workflow definitions.",
  "riskLevel": "high",
  "changeSet": {
    "purpose": "Move a client from lead to delivery kickoff with stronger evidence."
  },
  "idempotencyKey": "workflow-draft-proof-001",
  "sourceChannel": "api"
}
```

Behavior:

- derive workspace from auth and reject cross-workspace root references
- support draft roots for `process`, `pipeline`, and `procedure`
- list and read drafts for sessions with
  `company-os:workflow-definition:write`, including `rootObjectType`,
  `status`, and `limit` filters on the list route
- store `baseVersion`, `targetVersion`, `changeSet`, risk, actor, source
  channel, and idempotency key in `workflow_definition_drafts`
- return the existing draft on repeated create with the same workspace
  idempotency key
- update draft metadata/change set through `PATCH`
- generate impact previews with affected counts, changed fields, duplicate
  name risk, approval requirement, approval reasons, and target version
- emit `workflow_definition_draft_created`,
  `workflow_definition_draft_updated`, or
  `workflow_definition_draft_previewed`
- append matching audit evidence with a correlation ID

Draft create/update/preview do not activate workflow definitions. Rollback,
archive, and generic process/pipeline activation remain separate command
contracts.

Activation body:

```json
{
  "approvalId": "uuid",
  "sourceChannel": "api"
}
```

Current activation behavior:

- `process`, `pipeline`, and `procedure` drafts activate by creating a new
  active root version
- `processes`, `pipelines`, and `procedures` use
  `workspaceId + name + version` uniqueness for activated versions
- activated versions preserve `familyId`, so rollback can resolve the current
  active target even when the visible workflow name changes between versions
- stale drafts are rejected when the active root version no longer matches
  `baseVersion`
- activation requires an approved `approval` whose `resourceType` is
  `workflow_definition_draft` and whose `resourceId` is the draft ID whenever
  preview marks approval required
- activation sets the previous root version to `deprecated`, creates a new
  active root version, copies or applies pipeline stages/procedure steps when
  relevant, updates the draft to `active`, and emits
  `workflow_definition_draft_activated` plus
  `workflow_definition_draft.activated` audit evidence
- the response includes previous/new version IDs, rollback candidate context,
  approval ID, impact preview, correlation ID, and audit log ID

Archive historical version:

```http
POST /v1/company-os/workflow-definitions/:rootObjectType/:rootObjectId/actions/archive
```

Required capability: `company-os:workflow-definition:activate`.

Archive body:

```json
{
  "reason": "Archive deprecated v1 after v2 activation evidence exists.",
  "idempotencyKey": "archive-deprecated-pipeline-v1",
  "sourceChannel": "api"
}
```

Current archive behavior:

- `rootObjectType` must be `process`, `pipeline`, or `procedure`
- the target root must belong to the caller workspace
- active versions return `409 workflow_archive_active_version_blocked`
- inactive versions with active non-terminal runtime dependencies return
  `409 workflow_archive_active_runtime_dependency`
- already archived versions return `409 workflow_archive_already_archived`
  unless the same idempotency key is replayed
- safe inactive historical versions are set to `archived`
- the command emits `workflow_definition_version_archived` plus
  `workflow_definition_version.archived` audit evidence

Rollback is still a separate future command. The approved recovery direction is
to create rollback drafts from historical versions so rollback still flows
through preview and activation.

Create rollback draft:

```http
POST /v1/company-os/workflow-definitions/:rootObjectType/:rootObjectId/actions/create-rollback-draft
```

Required capability: `company-os:workflow-definition:write`.

Rollback-draft body:

```json
{
  "reason": "Prepare rollback to process v1 through normal draft activation.",
  "riskLevel": "medium",
  "idempotencyKey": "rollback-draft-process-v1",
  "sourceChannel": "api"
}
```

Current rollback-draft behavior:

- `rootObjectType` must be `process`, `pipeline`, or `procedure`
- the source root must be a non-active historical version in the caller
  workspace
- the current active version is resolved by matching workspace, root type, and
  `familyId`; if no active version exists, the route returns
  `409 workflow_rollback_active_version_not_found`
- active source versions return `409 workflow_rollback_source_active`
- the route creates a `workflow_definition_drafts` row against the current
  active root with `changeSet.kind = "rollback_to_version"`
- the draft stores rollback source root/version metadata in the change set,
  generates an impact preview, and emits
  `workflow_definition_rollback_draft_created` plus
  `workflow_definition_rollback_draft.created` audit evidence
- activation remains a separate existing command, so rollback does not bypass
  preview, approval, stale-version, audit, or event gates

### Company OS Lifecycle Commands

The first Company OS write surface is command-oriented instead of raw table
CRUD. MCP tools, UI affordances, policy checks, events, and audit logs must
stay aligned around these lifecycle routes.

#### Request Approval

```http
POST /v1/company-os/approvals/request
```

Required capability:

```text
company-os:approval:request
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "requestedByType": "agent",
  "requestedById": "agent-or-user-or-integration-id",
  "requestedForAction": "drive.file.update",
  "resourceType": "google_drive_file",
  "resourceId": "external-or-companycore-id",
  "riskLevel": "high",
  "approverRoleId": "uuid",
  "pipelineRunId": "uuid",
  "stageRunId": "uuid",
  "expiresAt": "2026-05-10T12:00:00.000Z",
  "inputPayload": {
    "reason": "Agent needs permission to update a client-facing document."
  }
}
```

Behavior:

- derive workspace from auth
- validate risk, actor, resource, and optional run links
- create a pending `approval`
- emit `approval_requested`
- append `approval.requested` audit evidence
- return the created approval and correlation ID

#### Decide Approval

```http
POST /v1/company-os/approvals/:id/decision
```

Required capability:

```text
company-os:approval:decide
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "decision": "approved",
  "decisionReason": "Scope and rollback plan are acceptable."
}
```

Allowed decisions:

- `approved`
- `rejected`

Behavior:

- require a pending, non-expired approval in the caller workspace
- set status, decision reason, approver user when available, and decision time
- emit `approval_approved` or `approval_rejected`
- append `approval.decided` audit evidence
- refuse already-decided approvals instead of silently overwriting decisions

#### Pipeline And Stage Commands

Pipeline and stage writes follow the same command shape:

```http
POST /v1/company-os/pipeline-runs/:id/actions/start-stage
POST /v1/company-os/stage-runs/:id/actions/complete
POST /v1/company-os/stage-runs/:id/actions/block
POST /v1/company-os/stage-runs/:id/actions/validate
```

These routes require an `approvalId` when policy, risk, stage definition, tool
capability, or integration capability says approval is required. They emit
events and audit logs with a shared correlation ID.

##### Start Stage

```http
POST /v1/company-os/pipeline-runs/:id/actions/start-stage
```

Required capability:

```text
company-os:pipeline-run:write
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "pipelineStageId": "uuid",
  "assignedActorType": "agent",
  "assignedActorId": "agent-or-user-id",
  "approvalId": "uuid",
  "inputPayload": {
    "taskId": "uuid"
  }
}
```

Behavior:

- require pipeline run in caller workspace
- require stage belongs to the pipeline definition
- create or resume a stage run for the selected stage
- set pipeline run status to `running` and current stage to the selected stage
- emit `stage_started`
- append `stage_run.started` audit evidence

##### Block Stage

```http
POST /v1/company-os/stage-runs/:id/actions/block
```

Required capability:

```text
company-os:stage-run:write
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "reason": "Waiting for client approval.",
  "approvalId": "uuid",
  "errorState": {
    "code": "client_input_missing"
  }
}
```

Behavior:

- require stage run in caller workspace
- mark stage run `blocked`
- append the block reason to stage logs
- set parent pipeline run `blocked` unless it is already terminal
- emit `stage_blocked`
- append `stage_run.blocked` audit evidence

##### Validate Stage

```http
POST /v1/company-os/stage-runs/:id/actions/validate
```

Required capability:

```text
company-os:stage-run:write
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "validationStatus": "passed",
  "validationResult": {
    "summary": "QA checklist passed."
  },
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "validationStatus": "passed",
      "evidence": {
        "testRun": "local"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Behavior:

- update stage validation result
- update acceptance criteria evidence in the same workspace and stage run
- emit `stage_validated`
- append `stage_run.validated` audit evidence
- do not complete the stage automatically

##### Complete Stage

```http
POST /v1/company-os/stage-runs/:id/actions/complete
```

Required capability:

```text
company-os:stage-run:write
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "approvalId": "uuid",
  "outputPayload": {
    "result": "Ready for next stage."
  },
  "validationResult": {
    "summary": "Required checks passed."
  }
}
```

Behavior:

- require current stage run status to be `running` or `blocked`
- require all required acceptance criteria to be `passed` or `waived`
- require approved approval when policy, risk, stage definition, or tool
  capability requires approval
- mark stage run `completed`
- keep parent pipeline run active for the next orchestration command
- emit `stage_completed`
- append `stage_run.completed` audit evidence

Invalid transitions should return `409` with a stable error code such as
`invalid_stage_transition`, `active_stage_run_exists`, `approval_required`,
`approval_not_approved`, or `acceptance_criteria_incomplete`.

#### Automation Rule Execution Direction

Automation rules and triggers are read through the Company OS collection API,
but execution must use command-shaped routes. The first backend evaluator route
is:

```http
POST /v1/company-os/events/:id/actions/evaluate-automation-rules
```

Required capability:

```text
company-os:automation:execute
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "ruleIds": ["uuid"],
  "mode": "execute",
  "idempotencyKey": "optional-client-key",
  "context": {
    "reason": "Evaluate follow-up work for a completed stage."
  }
}
```

Allowed modes:

- `dry_run`: evaluate active rules and return proposed actions without writes
- `execute`: evaluate active rules and execute only approved, allowlisted
  action proposals through existing lifecycle commands

Behavior:

- derive workspace from auth
- require the source event in the caller workspace
- match active triggers and active automation rules for the source event
- evaluate declarative rule conditions against the normalized event and
  related Company OS records
- produce a structured action proposal instead of executing arbitrary code
- require approval for risky or externally visible actions before execution
- create approval requests, informational events, or stage lifecycle command
  executions through the shared command functions
- emit `automation_rule_matched`, `automation_action_proposed`, or
  `automation_rule_failed`
- append `automation_rule.matched`, `automation_rule.action_proposed`, or
  `automation_rule.failed` audit evidence
- return matched rule IDs, proposed actions, approval requirements, emitted
  event IDs, audit log IDs, and fail-closed reasons

Allowed action kinds:

- `request_approval`
- `start_stage`
- `block_stage`
- `validate_stage`
- `complete_stage`
- `emit_event`

Automation routes must not accept raw database patches, provider-specific API
calls, or arbitrary script bodies. Reprocessing the same event/rule/action
target must be idempotency-safe and must not duplicate approvals or repeated
stage transitions.

Implemented execution behavior:

- `request_approval`: creates a pending approval, `approval_requested` event,
  and `approval.requested` audit evidence
- `emit_event`: emits the configured informational event
- `start_stage`, `block_stage`, `validate_stage`, and `complete_stage`:
  call the shared stage lifecycle command functions; command rejections become
  `automation_rule_failed` evidence with the stable lifecycle error

Lifecycle action enablement plan:

- stage lifecycle route handlers call shared internal command functions instead
  of keeping transition logic inside Express handlers
- the automation evaluator calls those shared command functions after writing
  automation-level proposal evidence
- lifecycle action inputs from automation rules must map to the same request
  body fields used by the HTTP command routes
- automation-level evidence must be written before command execution, while
  command-specific evidence remains owned by the shared lifecycle service
- if the shared command returns a stable conflict error such as
  `approval_required`, `invalid_stage_transition`, or
  `acceptance_criteria_incomplete`, the evaluator returns a skipped action with
  the same fail-closed reason instead of retrying through a different path

## Agent CRUD Rollout Policy

The active rollout plan for teaching agents to read and write CompanyCore data
is `docs/planning/agent-crud-api-rollout-plan.md`.

Agent-facing access must follow these rules:

- business records should converge on list, single-record read, create, update,
  and safe archive/delete routes
- system, auth, secret, provider inbox, webhook, event, and audit tables must
  expose controlled domain actions instead of raw CRUD
- agents must discover available operations through `GET /v1/connection`
  before attempting writes
- service clients must never send `workspaceId`; the API derives workspace
  ownership from auth
- raw API keys, passwords, provider tokens, webhook secrets, and raw provider
  failures must never be returned
- destructive behavior must be guarded by relation checks, workspace checks,
  and provider ownership checks

Business `DELETE` routes are soft lifecycle operations. They preserve database
history and relation integrity by setting the record status to `archived`, or
to `retired` for agents. They do not hard-delete rows.

Provider and system lifecycle routes are intentionally action-shaped. Agents
may use advertised routes such as event `ack`, provider-event `retry`,
webhook `reconcile`, Drive file `scope`, Drive file `description`, Drive
changes `reconcile`, and Docs/Sheets write actions. Agents must not infer or
call raw CRUD routes for system tables such as API keys, integration settings,
provider inbox rows, webhook registrations, event rows, users, workspaces, or
memberships.

Google Drive changes reconciliation is first-run safe. When no stored Drive
changes page token exists, `POST /v1/integration-settings/google_drive/changes/reconcile`
initializes a baseline with Drive `changes/startPageToken`, stores it in the
workspace integration config, emits a reconciliation event, and returns zero
processed changes with `baselineInitialized=true`. Later calls consume
`changes.list` from the stored token.

Current table policy summary:

| Area | Tables | Agent access target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Business records | `projects`, `goals`, `targets`, `task_lists`, `tasks`, `clients`, `pipeline_stages`, `deals`, `interactions`, `notes`, `decisions`, `agents` | Full workspace-scoped read/create/update plus safe archive/delete where allowed. |
| Agent observability | `agent_logs`, `agent_event_outbox`, `events` | Append/read or read/ack lifecycle; no broad raw delete. |
| Operating registry | `operating_areas`, `operating_folders`, `operating_tables`, `storage_locations`, `knowledge_roots`, `automation_definitions` | Scoped lifecycle APIs, with protected fallback/system records. |
| Provider registry | `external_container_mappings`, `external_field_mappings`, `google_drive_files`, `google_drive_content_snapshots`, `external_webhook_registrations`, `provider_event_inbox` | Provider-backed read, scope, refresh, retry, reconcile, and delete-through-provider actions. |
| Security and tenancy | `users`, `workspaces`, `workspace_memberships`, `api_keys`, `integration_settings` | Auth, owner account, API key, and provider settings actions only; no agent raw CRUD. |

## Operating Model

Adapters can read the workspace operating model and register scoped storage,
knowledge, and automation metadata through protected routes.

```

Write payloads derive `workspaceId` from auth. Optional `areaId`, `folderId`,
and `tableId` must belong to the active workspace and to each other; otherwise
the API returns `not_found`.

Operating area payload:

```json
{
  "name": "Customer onboarding",
  "description": "User-created area for a focused operating slice"
}
```

CompanyCore catalog areas are returned with `isSystem: true`. System areas,
including the protected fallback `00. Glowny` / `main-general`, cannot be
renamed or deleted through the API. User-created areas have `isSystem: false`
and can be deleted only with explicit reassignment:

```json
{
  "reassignToAreaId": "uuid"
}
```

Deleting a user-created area reassigns its operating folders, operating tables,
provider mappings, storage locations, knowledge roots, automation definitions,
and Google Drive file scope to the selected target area before removing the
area row.

Operating folder payload:

```json
{
  "areaId": "uuid",
  "name": "Agent memory",
  "description": "Folder for agent-readable operating context"
}
```

Folder deletion is guarded. If a folder owns operating tables, the API returns
`conflict` instead of deleting it. Storage locations, knowledge roots, and
automation definitions can be deleted directly because related provider/file
records use nullable references and keep their own history.

Storage location payload:

```json
{
  "tableId": "uuid",
  "provider": "google_drive",
  "name": "Goals folder",
  "locator": {
    "folderId": "drive-folder-id"
  }
}
```

Knowledge root payload:

```json
{
  "tableId": "uuid",
  "provider": "obsidian",
  "name": "Goals vault",
  "locator": {
    "path": "CompanyCore/Strategy/Goals"
  }
}
```

Automation definition payload:

```json
{
  "tableId": "uuid",
  "provider": "clickup",
  "triggerType": "scheduled_pull",
  "name": "Goals table scheduled pull",
  "config": {
    "cadence": "manual"
  }
}
```

## Projects

```http
GET /v1/projects
GET /v1/projects/:id
POST /v1/projects
PATCH /v1/projects/:id
DELETE /v1/projects/:id
GET /projects
GET /projects/:id
POST /projects
PATCH /projects/:id

```

```json
{

  "description": "Strategic work for Paperclip"
}
```

## Goals

```http

```

## Targets

POST /targets
PATCH /targets/:id
DELETE /targets/:id
```

```json
{
  "goalId": "uuid",
  "title": "Book 10 discovery calls",
  "metric": "calls",
  "targetValue": 10
}
```

## Task Lists

```http
GET /v1/task-lists
GET /v1/task-lists/:id
POST /v1/task-lists
PATCH /v1/task-lists/:id
DELETE /v1/task-lists/:id
GET /task-lists

```

```json
{
  "projectId": "uuid",
  "name": "Paperclip intake",
  "description": "Lead capture tasks",
  "source": "paperclip"
}
```

Task lists are workspace-scoped. If `projectId` is provided, it must belong to
the active workspace. v1 supports list/create/update and intentionally does not
delete task lists yet.

## Tasks

```http
GET /v1/tasks
GET /v1/tasks/:id
POST /v1/tasks
PATCH /v1/tasks/:id
DELETE /v1/tasks/:id
POST /v1/tasks/:id/clickup/custom-fields/:fieldId
POST /v1/tasks/sync/clickup
POST /v1/tasks/sync/clickup/native
GET /tasks
GET /tasks/:id
POST /tasks
PATCH /tasks/:id
DELETE /tasks/:id
POST /tasks/:id/clickup/custom-fields/:fieldId
POST /tasks/sync/clickup
POST /tasks/sync/clickup/native
```

```json
{
  "projectId": "uuid",
  "title": "Prepare outreach list",
  "status": "todo"
}
```

ClickUp sync payload for external/manual orchestration:

```json
{
  "externalId": "clickup-task-id",
  "title": "Follow up with lead",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "projectId": "uuid",
  "raw": {
    "sourceWorkflow": "n8n"
  }
}
```

The primary v1 ClickUp path should be the native CompanyCore ClickUp adapter.
`POST /tasks/sync/clickup` remains as a compatible ingestion endpoint for
tests, manual repair, or optional orchestration. Native sync should use the
active workspace's ClickUp settings and upsert by `(workspace_id, source,
external_id)`.

`POST /tasks/sync/clickup/native` triggers the native pull-only ClickUp adapter
for the authenticated workspace. It reads `teamId` and `listIds` from
`/integration-settings/clickup`, calls ClickUp using the encrypted workspace
token, applies the selected import mode, and emits sync events. The request
body may override the saved import mode for a single run:

```json
{
  "importMode": "merge"
}
```

Supported import modes:

- `merge`: default safe mode. Existing native CompanyCore records are left
  untouched. ClickUp records are upserted by `(workspace_id, source,
  external_id)`, so existing ClickUp tasks are updated and new ClickUp tasks are
  added.
- `skip_existing`: existing ClickUp tasks are left unchanged and only new
  ClickUp tasks are added.
- `replace_selected_lists`: after ClickUp fetch succeeds, existing
  `source = clickup` tasks under the selected ClickUp Lists are deleted and the
  fetched records are inserted fresh. Native/manual CompanyCore tasks are not
  deleted.
- `inspect_only`: fetches ClickUp and reports what would be created or updated
  without writing or deleting any task records.

Imported ClickUp task fields currently mapped:

- `name` -> `tasks.title`
- Markdown/plain description -> `tasks.description`
- ClickUp status/type -> `tasks.status`
- ClickUp priority label -> `tasks.priority`
- `due_date` -> `tasks.due_date`
- task ID -> `tasks.external_id`
- list ID -> matching `task_lists.external_id` when present or a created
  ClickUp task list when missing

This means task imports can preserve priority and land under the right
CompanyCore task list once ClickUp discovery has persisted the List mapping.

For ClickUp-sourced tasks, `PATCH /v1/tasks/:id` writes supported CompanyCore
edits back to ClickUp before saving the local update. Supported write-back
fields are title, description, status, priority, and due date. Provider
failures return the mapped integration error and emit `clickup_writeback_failed`.

When `POST /v1/tasks` targets a ClickUp-sourced task list, CompanyCore creates
the task in ClickUp first, then stores the returned ClickUp task ID as
`externalId` with `source = clickup`. This keeps CompanyCore as the API source
of truth while preserving ClickUp as the mapped external workspace/list surface.

`DELETE /v1/tasks/:id` archives ClickUp-sourced tasks in ClickUp before marking
the local task `archived`. Native/manual CompanyCore tasks are archived locally.

`POST /v1/tasks/:id/clickup/custom-fields/:fieldId` sets a mapped ClickUp Custom
Field value for a ClickUp-sourced task. The field must exist in
`external_field_mappings` for the workspace, and provider failures emit
`clickup_custom_field_update_failed`.

Safe native sync response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "provider": "clickup",
    "workspaceId": "uuid",
    "importMode": "merge",
    "itemCount": 12,
    "createdCount": 4,
    "updatedCount": 8,
    "skippedCount": 0,
    "deletedCount": 0,
    "wouldCreateCount": 0,
    "wouldUpdateCount": 0
  }
}
```

## Clients

```http
GET /clients
GET /clients/:id
POST /clients
PATCH /clients/:id
DELETE /clients/:id
```

```json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "companyName": "Example Co",
  "email": "jane@example.com"
}
```

## Pipeline Stages

```http
GET /v1/pipeline-stages
GET /v1/pipeline-stages/:id
POST /v1/pipeline-stages
PATCH /v1/pipeline-stages/:id
DELETE /v1/pipeline-stages/:id
GET /pipeline-stages
GET /pipeline-stages/:id
POST /pipeline-stages
PATCH /pipeline-stages/:id
DELETE /pipeline-stages/:id
```

```json
{
  "name": "Qualified",
  "position": 10,
  "source": "companycore"
}
```

Pipeline stages are workspace-scoped shared workflow configuration records.
CRM deals can use them, but the stage model is not owned by CRM. v1 supports
list/create/update and intentionally does not delete stages yet.

## Deals

```http
GET /deals
GET /deals/:id
POST /deals
PATCH /deals/:id
DELETE /deals/:id
```

```json
{
  "clientId": "uuid",
  "title": "Pilot contract",
  "value": 5000,
  "currency": "PLN"
}
```

## Interactions

```http
GET /v1/interactions
GET /v1/interactions/:id
POST /v1/interactions
PATCH /v1/interactions/:id
DELETE /v1/interactions/:id
GET /interactions
GET /interactions/:id
POST /interactions
PATCH /interactions/:id
DELETE /interactions/:id
```

```json
{
  "clientId": "uuid",
  "type": "email",
  "summary": "Paperclip captured a reply from the lead",
  "occurredAt": "2026-05-03T10:00:00.000Z",
  "source": "paperclip"
}
```

Interactions are workspace-scoped CRM timeline records. If `clientId` is
provided, it must belong to the active workspace.

## Notes

```http
GET /v1/notes
GET /v1/notes/:id
POST /v1/notes
PATCH /v1/notes/:id
DELETE /v1/notes/:id
GET /notes
GET /notes/:id
POST /notes
PATCH /notes/:id
DELETE /notes/:id
```

```json
{
  "projectId": "uuid",
  "content": "Important context for the next agent."
}
```

When a note is created against a ClickUp-sourced task, CompanyCore creates a
ClickUp task comment first and then stores the returned comment ID as the
note's `externalId` with `source = clickup`. If ClickUp rejects the comment,
the local note is not created and the API returns a safe integration error.

## Decisions

```http
GET /v1/decisions
GET /v1/decisions/:id
POST /v1/decisions
PATCH /v1/decisions/:id
DELETE /v1/decisions/:id
GET /decisions
GET /decisions/:id
POST /decisions
PATCH /decisions/:id
DELETE /decisions/:id
```

```json
{
  "title": "Use CompanyCore as source of truth",
  "rationale": "Agents need durable operational memory",
  "outcome": "approved",
  "projectId": "uuid"
}
```

## Agents

```http
GET /v1/agents
GET /v1/agents/:id
POST /v1/agents
PATCH /v1/agents/:id
DELETE /v1/agents/:id
GET /agents
GET /agents/:id
POST /agents
PATCH /agents/:id
DELETE /agents/:id
```

```json
{
  "name": "Jarvis",
  "role": "operations_agent",
  "status": "active",
  "source": "jarvis"
}
```

Agents are workspace-scoped. Use the returned `id` as `agentId` when writing
agent logs.

## Agent Logs

```http
GET /v1/agent-logs
GET /v1/agent-logs/:id
POST /v1/agent-logs
GET /agent-logs
GET /agent-logs/:id
POST /agent-logs
```

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Jarvis inspected CompanyCore memory",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "jarvis"
  }
}
```

## Provider Webhooks

```http
POST /v1/webhooks/clickup
```

This route is public at the transport layer because ClickUp calls it directly.
It is mounted before JSON parsing so CompanyCore can verify the exact raw body
against ClickUp's `X-Signature` HMAC SHA-256 header. Requests without
`X-Signature` return `missing_signature`, malformed payloads return
`invalid_webhook_payload`, unknown webhooks return `webhook_not_registered`,
and invalid signatures return `invalid_webhook_signature`.

Valid signed ClickUp events are stored idempotently in the provider inbox,
processed into CompanyCore task records, and status changes create
provider-neutral agent events for Paperclip, Jarvis, Aviary, and future
consumers.

ClickUp task comment events are mapped to CompanyCore notes attached to the
same task. The note uses `source = clickup` and the ClickUp comment ID as
`externalId`, so repeated webhook deliveries update the same note instead of
duplicating context.

## Global Intake

```http
GET /v1/intake
GET /intake
```

Required capability:

```text
intake:read
```

`GET /v1/intake` is the read-only `00 Main` queue for owner review and MCP
agents. It aggregates existing workspace records into one normalized routing
surface without acknowledging events, retrying providers, changing Drive scope,
or executing approvals.

Query:

| Name | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `family` | string | unset | Filters normalized intake families such as `agent_output`, `provider_signal`, `unassigned_resource`, `risk_or_approval`, and `feedback_signal`. |
| `status` | string | unset | Filters statuses such as `needs_classification`, `needs_owner_decision`, `ready_to_route`, and `blocked`. |
| `sourceAgent` | string | unset | Returns items for the selected agent plus broadcast agent events. |
| `risk` | string | unset | Filters `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical`. |
| `suggestedDepartment` | string | unset | Filters inferred department keys such as `04-operations` or `07-finance`. |
| `limit` | number | `100` | Maximum `200`. |

            "reason": "Intake is read-only; use POST /v1/agent-events/:id/ack after handling."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The MCP manifest exposes this endpoint as `companycore_get_intake` when the key
has `intake:read`. The canonical MCP profiles include `intake:read` so
Paperclip can inspect background work and route it through CompanyCore instead
of reading provider tables directly.

```http
POST /v1/intake/actions/propose-route
POST /intake/actions/propose-route
```

Required capability:

```text
intake:write
```

Creates a proposal-only classification or route record for one intake source
item. The command validates workspace ownership of the source item and the
canonical department key, then writes proposal evidence through CompanyCore
records. It does not acknowledge agent events, retry provider events, approve
work, change provider scope, invoice, discount, delete, or execute legal/ads
actions.

Body:

```json
{
  "sourceModel": "AgentEventOutbox",
  "sourceId": "event-uuid",
  "targetDepartmentKey": "03-sprzedaz",
  "classification": "route_to_department",
  "reason": "Paperclip output should be reviewed by Sales before any commercial action.",
  "proposedNextAction": "Create a Sales follow-up after owner review.",
  "riskLevel": "medium",
  "requestOwnerDecision": true,
  "createTaskDraft": true,
  "idempotencyKey": "paperclip-route-event-uuid-sales"
}
```

Allowed `sourceModel` values are `AgentEventOutbox`, `ProviderEventInbox`,
`GoogleDriveFile`, `ExternalContainerMapping`, `ExternalFieldMapping`,
`Approval`, `Risk`, `Task`, and `Event`.

Allowed `targetDepartmentKey` values are the canonical Company Atlas keys:
`00-ogolny`, `01-strategia`, `02-produkt`, `03-sprzedaz`, `04-operacje`,
`05-relacje`, `06-kadry`, `07-finanse`, `08-zasoby`, `09-technologia`,
`10-prawo`, `11-innowacje`, and `12-zarzadzanie`.

Safe response shape:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "proposal": {
      "id": "decision-uuid",
      "sourceModel": "AgentEventOutbox",
      "sourceId": "event-uuid",

      "sourceMutated": false,
      "agentEventAcknowledged": false,
      "providerStateMutated": false,
      "taskDraftCreated": true,
      "ownerDecisionRequested": true,

        "reason": "Invoice, discount, payment, legal, and ads changes require their own approval-aware command contracts."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Idempotent replays with the same source, target department, classification, and
idempotency key return the existing proposal with `idempotentReplay=true`.

## Agent Events

```http
GET /v1/agent-events
POST /v1/agent-events/:id/ack
```

Agents use `GET /v1/agent-events` with their CompanyCore API key to read
pending provider-neutral operational events. Optional query parameter
`targetAgent` returns events targeted to that agent plus broadcast events.
After handling an event, the agent calls `POST /v1/agent-events/:id/ack`.

## Events

```http
GET /v1/events
GET /events
```
