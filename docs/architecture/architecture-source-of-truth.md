# Architecture Source Of Truth

This document defines how architecture decisions should be treated in the
repository.

## Purpose

The `docs/architecture/` folder is the canonical record of the application's
approved architecture:

- system boundaries
- ownership of data and state
- module and integration contracts
- deployment shape
- technology choices that are already decided

Treat these files as implementation constraints, not as loose suggestions.

## Default Rule

- Build the application to match the approved architecture.
- Do not silently change architecture during implementation.
- Do not reinterpret unclear architecture in a way that expands scope.
- If implementation exposes a gap or mismatch, stop implementation and escalate
  before changing architectural direction.
- Prefer asking for a decision over shipping an incorrect workaround.

## What Agents May Do Without Re-Approving Architecture

- implement work that fits the documented boundaries
- add clarifying detail that does not change behavior or ownership
- document discovered inconsistencies
- propose follow-up tasks that improve implementation quality inside the
  approved architecture

## What Requires Explicit User Approval First

- changing module boundaries or service responsibilities
- moving source-of-truth ownership for data or state
- replacing an approved integration pattern with another one
- changing deployment topology or runtime shape
- changing a confirmed tech-stack decision that affects architecture
- introducing a new cross-cutting pattern that contradicts existing
  architecture docs

## Mandatory Decision Flow For Mismatches

When implementation does not fit approved architecture:

1. describe the mismatch clearly
2. propose 2 to 3 valid options with tradeoffs
3. wait for explicit user decision

Agents must not self-approve a workaround or architecture rewrite.

If there is a strong argument for a better design, the agent should present the
case in conversation first, including tradeoffs and why the current
architecture may be insufficient. The agent must not self-approve the change.

## Required Architecture Files

At minimum, keep these files aligned:

- `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/autonomous-company-operating-system.md`
- `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- `docs/architecture/organizational-architecture-bridge.md`
- `docs/architecture/companycore-business-module-map.md`
- `docs/architecture/companycore-global-business-flow.md`
- `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-v1-blueprint.md`
- `docs/architecture/company-os-definition-editing-contract.md`
- `docs/architecture/company-os-workflow-definition-command-contract.md`
- `docs/architecture/web-and-mcp-foundation-before-v2.md`
- `docs/architecture/relationship-graph-audit-2026-05-14.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `docs/planning/auth-workspace-integration-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/regression-prevention-plan.md`

Projects may add more architecture docs or ADRs, but these baseline files
should always stay current.

## CompanyCore v1 Approved Direction

The approved v1 direction is:

- API-first product foundation with a minimal owner-only web console for v1
  ClickUp setup
- CompanyCore is the company operating system, not an embedded AI system;
  humans use web UI and AI agents use API/MCP as external clients
- PostgreSQL is the source of truth
- API is the supported access layer for agents, automations, future dashboards,
  and future mobile clients
- owner registration creates a workspace
- business data, service API keys, integration settings, and integration sync
  state are workspace-scoped
- ClickUp is the first native integration adapter
- CompanyCore should evolve toward a ClickUp-shaped operating model:
  `Workspace -> Operating Area -> Operating Folder -> Operating Table ->
  Record`, mapped to ClickUp `Team/Workspace -> Space -> Folder -> List ->
  Task`
- first-party business tables should be assigned to an approved operating area;
  `00. Glowny` is the non-removable fallback area for unclassified imports,
  followed by the 12 company departments, while users, memberships, API keys,
  integration settings, provider mappings, and platform metadata remain system
  tables
- provider imports must expose an explicit existing-record policy before
  writing; ClickUp supports `merge`, `skip_existing`,
  `replace_selected_lists`, and `inspect_only`, with deletes limited to
  provider-owned records in the selected scope
- n8n remains optional orchestration, not the required primary ClickUp path
- schema changes should move from `prisma db push` to controlled migrations
- tests and smoke checks must prove workspace scoping and integration sync
  behavior before v1 is considered stable
- full company dashboard and mobile app are v2 scope; mobile should follow the
  web product experience
- before V2 Company City, gamification, or native mobile app work, the product
  must finish the web/backend/MCP foundation described in
  `docs/architecture/web-and-mcp-foundation-before-v2.md`: workspace selection,
  operating-area/resource navigation, relationship/integration clarity, and
  MCP workspace-safe usability
- CompanyCore's long-term product architecture is an AI-first organizational
  operating system where vertical hierarchy and horizontal processes coexist.
  The accepted direction is recorded in
  `docs/architecture/organizational-architecture-bridge.md` and must guide
  future schema, MCP, web, mobile, Paperclip, governance, knowledge, KPI, and
  organizational graph work without bypassing scoped task contracts or existing
  Company OS boundaries.
- CompanyCore should scale through model-level business modules recorded in
  `docs/architecture/companycore-business-module-map.md`. Future views and
  agent tools should derive from those modules and classify work as native
  core, provider-backed, future adapter, or derived view before adding schema,
  API, UI, or MCP surfaces.
- CompanyCore's global business flow is recorded in
  `docs/architecture/companycore-global-business-flow.md`. Future CRM,
  marketing, product/service delivery, finance, support, feedback, and
  improvement work should derive from the 13-stage value pipeline before
  adding runtime surfaces.
- CompanyCore V1 department views should become department management systems
  as recorded in
  `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-architecture.md`. Each of
  the 13 areas is a scalable management system over shared tables, pipelines,
  tasks, knowledge, resources, metrics, decisions, governance, and AI/MCP
  tools, not a separate database or provider-led app.
- The V1 implementation blueprint for the 12 operating department systems and
  `00 Main` orchestration is recorded in
  `docs/architecture/department-management-systems-v1-blueprint.md`. Future
  department web/backend work should use that document to define each
  department's purpose, subsystems, shared backend reuse, backend gaps, agent
  packet, safe actions, and recommended implementation order before coding.

## Implementation Contract

Before architecture-impacting work is marked complete, confirm:

- the task still fits the approved architecture
- any deviation was explicitly approved
- the architecture docs and implementation remain synchronized
- no workaround path was introduced to bypass architecture constraints
- existing mechanisms were reused before proposing new structures
