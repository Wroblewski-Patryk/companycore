# Web Layer React Ownership

Last updated: 2026-05-15

## Decision

CompanyCore web UI is React-owned. The backend may still serve static files,
health endpoints, and JSON APIs, but user-facing web routes must render through
the Vite React bundle in `public/react/index.html`.

As of 2026-05-16, `/` is the canonical public home route and
`/areas?area=00-ogolny&view=overview` is the canonical authenticated
post-login landing route. `/dashboard` and `/react-dashboard` remain temporary
compatibility aliases that redirect to the `00 Ogolny` selected-area
dashboard.

React route metadata now lives in `web/src/app-route-registry.ts`. That file is
the source of truth for route groups, canonical hrefs, aliases, prefix matches,
shell navigation entries, route titles, and safe post-auth redirect
normalization. The route registry also carries lightweight UX maturity markers;
the human-readable view maturity source is
`docs/ux/v1-web-view-index-2026-05-15.md`. Future web views must extend the
registry and the view index instead of adding page-local sidebar links or
manual route checks.

The legacy vanilla owner console files under `public/` are removed from the
active runtime path:

- `public/index.html`
- `public/app.js`
- `public/styles.css`
- `public/relationship-workbench.js`
- `public/google-drive-workbench.js`

## Route Ownership

The Express web host serves the React bundle for:

- `/`
- `/auth/login`
- `/auth/register`
- `/dashboard`
- `/areas`
- `/relationships`
- `/data`
- `/data/:table`
- `/tasks-adapter`
- `/pipeline`
- `/settings`
- `/settings/account`
- `/settings/integrations`
- `/settings/drive`
- `/settings/api`
- `/react-agent-tools`
- `/react-company-os`
- `/react-areas`
- `/react-dashboard`
- `/react-integrations`
- `/react-tasks`

API hosts still use the existing JSON API behavior. Protected backend contracts
remain under `/v1/*` and root protected compatibility routes.

## Implementation Rules

- New web UI must be implemented in `web/src/` using React, Tailwind, DaisyUI,
  and existing shared route-kit helpers.
- Do not reintroduce page-local vanilla JavaScript for product routes.
- Shared data fetching, auth redirect behavior, and route primitives should
  live in React helpers or route-kit modules, not global browser scripts.
- Add new authenticated views through `web/src/app-route-registry.ts` first,
  then bind the route component in `web/src/main.tsx`.
- Shared shell navigation must be derived from the route registry so desktop
  and mobile route chrome stay consistent.
- React views must consume existing backend endpoints. UI may simplify a
  workflow during migration, but it must not fake backend state.
- Deep workflows that were previously only vanilla must be rebuilt as React
  slices against the existing backend contracts.

## Current React Coverage

The first consolidation slice covers the active web routing layer and baseline
React views for:

- owner login and registration
- Company Atlas dashboard
- operating areas
- relationship graph review
- data table browsing
- tasks workbench
- pipeline / CRM
- integration health
- Google Drive status and imported files
- agent API keys
- account context
- ClickUp bridge status
- Company OS cockpit
- MCP tool surface

These routes are not equally finished. `docs/ux/v1-web-view-index-2026-05-15.md`
classifies each active route as `V1 canonical`, `V1 foundation`, `V0 rebuild`,
`V0 compatibility`, or `V2 deferred`. As of 2026-05-15, only `/dashboard` and
`/areas?area=:areaKey&view=:viewId` are V1 canonical surfaces.

## Area Detail Routing

The area-first V1 surface uses `/areas` for two related but distinct jobs:

- `/areas`: all-areas operating workbench for reviewing coverage, ownership,
  mapping queues, and lifecycle controls.
- `/areas?area=:areaKey&view=:viewId`: canonical selected-department view
  opened from the Company Atlas dashboard.

The selected-department view must stay area-first. Capability views such as
`overview`, `goals`, `workflows`, `tasks`, `knowledge`, `resources`,
`decisions`, and `ai` are contextual tabs inside the selected area, not new
global sidebar modules.

## Known Follow-Up

The legacy ClickUp token discovery and list-selection form is intentionally not
copied as vanilla. The current React `/settings` route shows real ClickUp
connection status from `/v1/connection`; a later React slice should rebuild the
guided connector form against:

- `POST /v1/integration-settings/clickup/discover`
- `PUT /v1/integration-settings/clickup`
- `POST /v1/integration-settings/clickup/maintenance/run`

The Google Drive React route currently exposes readiness, imported files, and
safe import/reconcile actions. A later React slice should rebuild the full OAuth
client, folder discovery, selection, and exchange workflow if owner re-consent
must happen through the browser UI.
