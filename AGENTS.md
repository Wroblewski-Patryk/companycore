# AGENTS.md - Unified Project Conductor Standard

## Purpose

This repository follows a multi-agent workflow so multiple chats can run in
parallel without losing source-of-truth quality, deployment discipline, or
documentation parity.

## Core Rules (All Agents)

### 1. Architecture Is Source Of Truth

- `docs/architecture/` is the single architecture authority.
- Implementation must match approved architecture.
- If something does not fit architecture, stop implementation and report the
  mismatch first.
- Do not silently rewrite architecture during delivery.

### 2. Critical Prohibitions

- Do not create new systems without explicit approval.
- Do not introduce workarounds or temporary bypasses.
- Do not duplicate logic that already exists in approved paths.
- Do not ignore existing mechanisms that already solve the need.
- Always reuse existing systems first.

### 3. Decision Mode For Architecture Gaps

When a blocker or mismatch appears, do not ship a fast workaround. Instead:

1. describe the problem clearly
2. propose 2 to 3 valid implementation options
3. wait for explicit user decision before continuing

### 4. Task Contract Is Mandatory

Every task must be written using `.codex/templates/task-template.md` and must
include:

- `Goal`
- `Scope` with exact files, modules, APIs, schemas, or docs
- `Implementation Plan`
- `Acceptance Criteria`
- `Definition of Done`
- `Result Report`

The task contract must be testable. A task without scope, acceptance criteria,
Definition of Done, and result report is not eligible for `DONE`.

### 5. Scope Discipline

- Stay inside the approved task.
- Do not extend scope unless explicitly requested.
- Do not change architecture during implementation unless explicitly approved.

### 6. Mandatory Review And Refactor Pass

After each implementation, verify:

- architecture alignment
- existing system reuse
- no workaround added
- no logic duplication introduced

If any check fails, fix before closing the task.

Always run a brief cleanup pass when needed:

- remove workaround remnants
- unify duplicated or divergent code paths
- simplify where complexity was added by implementation pressure

### 7. Working Cycle

Follow `docs/governance/autonomous-engineering-loop.md` for every autonomous
iteration:

1. analyze current state
2. select exactly one priority task
3. plan implementation
4. execute implementation
5. verify and test
6. self-review
7. update documentation and knowledge

Before starting an iteration, perform the process self-audit from that document.
Do not continue until all seven steps, one-task scope, and the correct operation
mode are represented in the task contract.

Operation mode rotates by iteration number:

- `BUILDER`: default mode
- `ARCHITECT`: every third iteration, unless the iteration is also a tester
  iteration
- `TESTER`: every fifth iteration

Use `.agents/core/operating-system.md` as the startup and continuation path for
non-trivial work. Use `.agents/core/execution-loop.md`,
`.agents/core/anti-regression.md`, and `.agents/core/quality-gates.md` for the
iteration checklist, regression hunt, and validation contract. Keep
`.agents/state/*` current enough that a future session can continue from repo
state without hidden chat memory.

### 8. Stage-Based Delivery Workflow

Every task must declare its current delivery stage and the output expected from
that stage.

Supported stages:
- `intake`
- `analysis`
- `planning`
- `implementation`
- `verification`
- `release`
- `post-release`

Stage contract:
- `intake`: clarify request, scope, constraints, and unknowns
- `analysis`: inspect the current state and identify the implementation surface
- `planning`: define ordered execution steps, validation, and rollout shape
- `implementation`: make the approved scoped change only
- `verification`: prove the result against acceptance criteria
- `release`: prepare merge, deploy, handoff, and rollback notes
- `post-release`: define monitoring, success signals, and follow-up actions

Rules:
- Do not skip stages implicitly.
- Do not implement during `analysis` or `planning` unless explicitly requested.
- Do not declare a task complete without `verification` evidence.
- If missing information materially affects quality or risk, stop at the current
  stage and surface the gap.
- Prefer the smallest safe assumption set and state assumptions explicitly.

### 9. Execution Posture

- Better to stop and ask than ship a wrong solution.
- Agents execute within architecture constraints and do not self-appoint as
  architecture owners.
- Project state, task board, planning docs, and governance docs are source of
  truth unless the repository defines additional canonical files.
- Do not leave resolved architecture decisions only in planning docs or
  closure notes.
- When the repository uses `docs/modules/`, keep them implementation-facing and
  linked back to architecture instead of redefining runtime truth.
- When a project has an established visual system, reuse existing shared
  patterns before creating new component variants or page-local styles.
- When a project has no strong visual direction yet, establish one early and
  keep it consistent across surfaces.
- When a canonical screenshot, mockup, or approved screen image exists, treat
  it as a specification instead of loose inspiration.
- For screenshot-driven UX/UI work, close one surface at a time and require an
  explicit `95%` parity judgment before moving to dependent surfaces.
- When user notes modify a canonical visual, treat the visual plus those notes
  as the active merged spec.
- If user notes conflict with each other or with an approved interpretation,
  stop and ask for a decision before implementing.
- Do not silently lower visual fidelity by replacing needed image assets,
  illustrations, or textured backgrounds with generic gradients.
- Treat mobile, tablet, and desktop as distinct experience surfaces with
  different density, navigation, and input expectations.
- All repository artifacts must be written in English.
- AI communication with end users should follow the user's language.
- Never reference sibling repositories or `!template` paths from project docs.
- Keep root minimal. Project documentation belongs in `docs/`.
- Every meaningful change updates at least one relevant source-of-truth file:
  - `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `.codex/context/LEARNING_JOURNAL.md` when a recurring pitfall is confirmed
  - `docs/planning/*`
  - project docs or ADRs when behavior, scope, or architecture changed
- Keep commits tiny, single-purpose, and reversible.
- Before creating a commit, run local quality gates proactively:
  - lint
  - typecheck
  - tests
  - stack-specific high-risk checks
- Do not create a commit when required quality gates fail, unless the user
  explicitly approves a temporary exception.
- Run relevant validation for changed scope, or explain why it could not run.
- Do not mark a task done without acceptance-criteria evidence.
- Do not mark a task done without validating `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`.
- Do not accept integrated runtime work without validating
  `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Do not ship placeholders, mock-only behavior, fake data, "for now" fixes, or
  temporary bypasses. Follow `NO_TEMPORARY_SOLUTIONS.md`.
- Deliver features as vertical slices across UI, logic, API, DB, validation,
  error handling, and tests.
- For AI-assisted, auth-sensitive, or money-impacting flows, include adversarial
  and fail-closed validation before completion.
- AI systems must be tested against prompt injection, data leakage, and
  unauthorized access before deployment.
- AI features must pass multi-step scenarios from `AI_TESTING_PROTOCOL.md`
  before completion.
- When a recurring environment or tooling pitfall is discovered, record it in
  `.codex/context/LEARNING_JOURNAL.md` in the same task.
- Before saying "nothing is planned" or "no tasks are queued", run a planning
  source-of-truth cross-check:
  - Tier 1: active canonical planning files
  - Tier 2: background or historical unchecked checklists, clearly labeled as
    non-active if they are not part of the canonical queue
- When active work is unclear in a medium or large project, use the function
  coverage ledger model in
  `docs/governance/function-coverage-ledger-standard.md` to turn module
  confidence gaps into explicit planning rows before inventing new features.
- Treat the function coverage ledger as an index of product confidence, not a
  replacement for tests, architecture docs, or the task board.
- If a project has an active coverage ledger, derive follow-up tasks in this
  order:
  - `V1_BLOCKER` or equivalent release blockers
  - `REQUIRES_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW`
  - `IMPLEMENTED_NEEDS_EVIDENCE` for `P0`
  - `IMPLEMENTED_NOT_VERIFIED` for `P0/P1`
  - `P1/P2` scope decisions or deferrals
- Do not convert every `PARTIAL` or evidence-missing ledger row into feature
  work. Plan verification first, then create a narrow fix only when proof or
  code inspection finds a real defect.
- Follow the default delivery loop:
  - analyze current state
  - select one priority task
  - plan implementation
  - execute implementation
  - verify and test
  - self-review
  - update documentation and knowledge
  - repeat
- Follow `.agents/workflows/user-collaboration.md` when a task involves
  ambiguous intent, user-authored visual notes, blocker decisions, or a handoff
  between planning and execution.
- Follow `.agents/workflows/world-class-delivery.md` for substantial product,
  runtime, release, UX, security, or AI work.
- For substantial changes, define why the work matters, the smallest safe
  slice, the success signal, the main failure mode, and the rollback or recovery
  path.
- For deployable services or important journeys, use
  `docs/operations/service-reliability-and-observability.md` to define SLIs,
  SLOs, health checks, alert routes, and error-budget posture when appropriate.
- For auth, AI, money, secrets, permissions, integrations, or user-data work,
  use `docs/security/secure-development-lifecycle.md`.
- After launch or deploy, capture what was learned from smoke checks, incidents,
  metrics, or user feedback before declaring the loop complete.

## Trigger Intent

If the user sends a short execution nudge (`rob`, `dzialaj`, `start`, `go`,
`next`, `lecimy`):
1. Read `.agents/core/operating-system.md` and refresh `.agents/state/*`.
2. Read `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md` and `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`.
3. Take the first `NOW` item that maps to a `READY` or `IN_PROGRESS` task.
4. If planning docs, board, and `.agents/state/next-steps.md` drift, sync them
   before implementation.
5. Implement exactly one tiny task.
6. Run relevant checks.
7. Update task, project state, planning files, and `.agents/state/*`.
8. Return summary with files changed, tests run, deployment impact, and next
   tiny task.

If a new execution wave or detailed implementation plan is published:
1. activate the first executable tasks in canonical queue files in the same
   turn
2. update `NOW` and `NEXT`
3. if useful for larger waves, also update `PIPELINE` and `GROUP QUEUE`
4. do not leave a new plan without an actionable canonical queue

## Workflow Contract

1. Product and architecture truth live in `docs/`.
2. Planning work translates truth into executable tasks and a small `NOW`
   queue.
3. Builder agents implement one scoped task at a time.
4. QA, Security, and Review agents validate before completion.
5. After validation, check for cleaner architecture or smaller follow-up tasks.
6. Refresh priorities and repeat with the next smallest valuable task.

All tasks must also respect the stage-based delivery workflow above:
- declare `Task Type`
- declare `Current Stage`
- declare `Deliverable For This Stage`
- keep output aligned to the active stage only

Documentation-governance rule:
- Use `.agents/workflows/documentation-governance.md` to decide whether new
  truth belongs in architecture, modules, planning, operations, or UX docs.
- Use `docs/governance/function-coverage-ledger-standard.md` when a release,
  handoff, incident, or stalled queue needs a module-by-module confidence map.
  Store active release ledgers under `docs/operations/` and derive executable
  tasks into `docs/planning/` plus `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md`.

## Subagent Contract (Codex)

- Delegate only independent or clearly bounded subtasks.
- Keep critical-path blocking work local.
- Assign explicit ownership for delegated write scope.
- Avoid overlapping file ownership between parallel workers.
- Require delegated output to report:
  - objective completed
  - files changed
  - validations run
  - residual risks
  - next suggested step
- Integrate and verify delegated output before closing tasks.
- Follow `.agents/workflows/subagent-orchestration.md`.

## UX/UI Contract

For UX/UI tasks, always include:
- design source reference (Figma link/node or approved snapshot)
- existing design-system pattern reused, or clear justification for a new
  shared pattern
- expected states (`loading`, `empty`, `error`, `success`)
- responsive checks (`desktop`, `tablet`, `mobile`)
- accessibility checks
- parity evidence in task or review notes
- evidence that the screen answers the key user questions quickly: what matters
  now, what is blocked, and what the next action is

Design-source policy:
- Primary source: Figma MCP for implementation context.
- Secondary source: Stitch MCP for ideation or draft exploration only.
- Stitch-only output cannot be the sole source of truth for final
  implementation unless the repository explicitly documents an approved
  exception workflow.
- For pixel-close implementation from screenshots, approved mockups, or
  canonical images, use `docs/ux/canonical-visual-implementation-workflow.md`
  and record the active spec, the mismatch list, and the parity judgment.
- Work through shared shell and layout dependencies before polishing route
  modules that depend on them.
- Capture a fresh screenshot after each meaningful surface slice and compare it
  to the active spec before opening a new visual lane.
- Use `docs/ux/evidence-driven-ux-review.md` for full-route clickthroughs,
  broad UX audits, or UI work that needs to turn screenshots into actionable
  implementation slices.
- Do not expose raw backend, provider, or validation errors directly to end
  users when a user-language recovery message and action can be provided.
- Keep feedback local to the action whenever possible: loading, error, and
  success states should appear where the user acted.
- If the repository has project UX docs, follow them. Otherwise record the
  design source directly in task notes or PR notes.
- If the repository has a documented design-system contract, agents must reuse
  existing shared patterns before introducing new visual variants.
- Record approved reusable UI patterns and verified UX learnings in
  `docs/ux/design-memory.md` when they should influence future work.
- Use the UX starter docs to keep direction explicit:
  - `docs/ux/visual-direction-brief.md` for product visual thesis
  - `docs/ux/ui-scorecard.md` for review quality scoring
  - `docs/ux/pattern-gallery.md` for screen-level reuse
  - `docs/ux/screen-quality-checklist.md` before calling a flow polished
  - `docs/ux/anti-patterns.md` to avoid recurring mistakes
  - `docs/ux/brand-personality-tokens.md` for consistent experience character
  - `docs/ux/canonical-visual-implementation-workflow.md` for pixel-close
    delivery from approved visuals
  - `docs/ux/background-and-decorative-asset-strategy.md` for image-rich
    decorative fidelity

## Deployment Contract

This template assumes VPS hosting with Coolify as the default deployment path.

Every deployable project should define:
- hosting target and topology in `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- deployment contract in `docs/operations/coolify-vps-deployment-contract.md`
- post-deploy smoke in `docs/operations/post-deploy-smoke.md`
- rollback procedure in `docs/operations/rollback-and-recovery.md`
- reliability and observability expectations in
  `docs/operations/service-reliability-and-observability.md`
- real env examples for every runtime surface
- health endpoints or equivalent readiness checks

If the project does not use Coolify, keep the same contract but document the
alternative deploy surface explicitly.

## Optional Deep-Dive Docs

When a repository grows beyond a small single-surface app, add:
- `docs/modules/README.md`
- `docs/modules/system-modules.md`
- `docs/modules/module-deep-dive-template.md`
- `docs/modules/module-doc-status-index.md`

These files help agents keep code ownership, routes, and test surfaces mapped
without overloading architecture docs.

## Template Usage Mode

This repository bootstrap is maintained in manual mode:
- start from this repository bootstrap package
- rename the project folder
- open it in Codex
- finalize project details through conversation and targeted file updates

## Pre-Commit Quality Gate

Use the validation commands recorded in `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md` as the
required pre-commit contract.

## Template Sync: App Creation, Feedback, And Handoff

- Use `docs/governance/app-creation-playbook.md` and `.codex/templates/app-blueprint-template.md` before broad implementation of a new app, major module, dashboard, tool, website, game, or product surface.
- Use `docs/governance/user-feedback-loop.md` and `.codex/templates/user-feedback-item-template.md` when user feedback changes behavior, UX, visual direction, copy, priority, architecture, validation, or future screen decisions.
- For substantial or multi-session work, finish with a concise handoff packet from `.codex/templates/handoff-packet-template.md`.
